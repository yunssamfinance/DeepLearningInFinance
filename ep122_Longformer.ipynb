            "ITEM 1. BUSINESS Overview We design, develop, manufacture, sell and lease high-performance fully electric vehicles and energy generation and storage systems, and offer services related to our sustainable energy products. We generally sell our products directly to customers, including through our website and retail locations. We also continue to grow our customer-facing infrastructure through a global network of vehicle service centers, Mobile Service technicians, body shops, Supercharger stations and Destination Chargers to accelerate the widespread adoption of our products. We emphasize performance, attractive styling and the safety of our users and workforce in the design and manufacture of our products and are continuing to develop full self-driving technology for improved safety. We also strive to lower the cost of ownership for our customers through continuous efforts to reduce manufacturing costs and by offering financial services tailored to our products. Our mission to accelerate the world s transition to sustainable energy, engineering expertise, vertically integrated business model and focus on user experience differentiate us from other companies. Segment Information We operate as two reportable segments: (i) automotive and (ii) energy generation and storage. The automotive segment includes the design, development, manufacturing, sales and leasing of electric vehicles as well as sales of automotive regulatory credits. Additionally, the automotive segment is also comprised of services and other, which includes non-warranty after-sales vehicle services, sales of used vehicles, retail merchandise, sales by our acquired subsidiaries to third party customers and vehicle insurance revenue. The energy generation and storage segment includes the design, manufacture, installation, sales and leasing of solar energy generation and energy storage products and related services and sales of solar energy systems incentives. Our Products and Services Automotive Model 3 Model 3 is a four-door mid-size sedan that we designed for manufacturability with a base price for mass-market appeal, which we began delivering in July 2017. We currently manufacture Model 3 at the Fremont Factory and at Gigafactory Shanghai. Model Y Model Y is a compact sport utility vehicle SUV built on the Model 3 platform with seating for up to seven adults, which we began delivering in March 2020. We currently manufacture Model Y at the Fremont Factory and at Gigafactory Shanghai. Model S and Model X Model S is a four-door full-size sedan that we began delivering in June 2012. Model X is a mid-size SUV with seating for up to seven adults, which we began delivering in September 2015. Model S and Model X feature the highest performance characteristics and longest ranges that we offer in a sedan and SUV, respectively, and we manufacture both models at the Fremont Factory. Future Consumer and Commercial Electric Vehicles We have also announced several planned electric vehicles to address additional vehicle markets, including specialized consumer electric vehicles in Cybertruck and the new Tesla Roadster and a commercial electric vehicle in Tesla Semi. We also plan to introduce in the future a lower-cost vehicle to leverage developments in our proprietary Full Self-Driving FSD ), battery cell and other technologies. Energy Generation and Storage Energy Storage Products We began deliveries of the most recent generations of Powerwall, Powerpack and Megapack, which are our lithium-ion battery energy storage products integrated with inverters and control technology, in 2016, 2017 and 2019, respectively. Powerwall is designed to store energy at a home or small commercial facility. Megapack and Powerpack are energy storage solutions for commercial, industrial, utility and energy generation customers, which may be grouped together to form larger installations capable of reaching gigawatt hours GWh or greater. We also offer integrated systems combining energy generation and storage. Our energy storage products are currently assembled at Gigafactory Nevada. 4 We have also develop ed software capabilities for remotely control ling and dispatch ing our energy storage systems across a wide range of markets and applications , including through our real-time energy trading platform . Solar Energy Offerings We sell retrofit solar energy systems to customers and channel partners and also make them available through lease and power purchase agreement PPA arrangements and a subscription-based sale of solar power, which is currently available in limited U.S. markets. We purchase most of the components for our retrofit solar energy systems from multiple sources to ensure competitive pricing and adequate supply. We also design and manufacture certain components for our solar energy products. In 2019, we commenced direct customer and channel partner sales of the third generation of our Solar Roof, which combines premium glass roof tiles with energy generation. We are ramping the volume production of Solar Roof at Gigafactory New York, and we are improving our installation capability and efficiency. Technology Automotive Battery and Powertrain Our core vehicle technology competencies include powertrain engineering and manufacturing and our ability to design vehicles that utilize the unique advantages of an electric powertrain. We have designed our proprietary powertrain systems to be adaptable, efficient, reliable and cost-effective while withstanding the rigors of an automotive environment. We offer dual motor powertrain vehicles, which use two electric motors to maximize traction and performance in an all-wheel drive configuration, and are introducing vehicle powertrain technology featuring three electric motors for further increased performance. Among other things, we maintain extensive testing and R&D capabilities for battery cells, packs and systems, and have built an expansive body of knowledge on lithium-ion cell chemistry types and performance characteristics. In order to enable a greater supply of cells for our products with higher energy density at lower costs, we are currently using our expertise to develop a new proprietary lithium-ion battery cell and improved manufacturing processes. Vehicle Control and Infotainment Software The performance and safety systems of our vehicles and their battery packs require sophisticated control software. Control systems in our vehicles optimize performance, customize vehicle behavior, manage charging and control all infotainment functions. We develop almost all of this software, including most of the user interfaces, internally and update our vehicles software regularly through over-the-air updates. Self-Driving Development We have expertise in developing technologies, systems and software to enable self-driving vehicles using primarily vision and radar-based sensors. Our FSD Computer runs our neural networks in our vehicles, and we are also developing additional computer hardware to better enable the massive amounts of field data captured by our vehicles to continually train and improve these neural networks for real-world performance. Currently, we offer in our vehicles certain advanced driver assist systems under our Autopilot and FSD options. Although at present the driver is ultimately responsible for controlling the vehicle, our systems provide safety and convenience functionality that relieves drivers of the most tedious and potentially dangerous aspects of road travel much like the system that airplane pilots use, when conditions permit. As with other vehicle systems, we improve these functions in our vehicles over time through over-the-air updates. We intend to establish in the future an autonomous Tesla ride-hailing network, which we expect would also allow us to access a new customer base even as modes of transportation evolve. Energy Generation and Storage Energy Storage Products We leverage many of the component-level technologies from our vehicles in our energy storage products. By taking a modular approach to the design of battery systems, we can optimize manufacturing capacity among our energy storage products. Additionally, our expertise in power electronics enables us to interconnect our battery systems seamlessly with global electricity grids while providing fast-acting systems for power injection and absorption. We have also developed the software to remotely control and dispatch our energy storage systems using our real-time energy trading platform. 5 Solar Energy Systems We have engineered Solar Roof over numerous iterations to combine aesthetic appeal and durability with power generation. The efficiency of our solar energy products is aided by our own solar inverter, which also incorporates our power electronics technologies. We designed both products to integrate with Powerwall. Design and Engineering Automotive We have established significant in-house capabilities in the design and test engineering of electric vehicles and their components and systems. Our team has core competencies in computer aided design as well as durability, strength and crash test simulations, which reduces the product development time of new models. Additionally, our team has expertise in selecting and working with a range of materials for our vehicles to balance performance, cost and durability in ways that are best suited for our vehicles target demographics and utility. We have also used our capabilities to achieve complex engineering feats in stamping, casting and thermal systems, and are currently developing designs that integrate batteries directly with vehicle body structures without separate battery packs to optimize manufacturability, weight, range and cost characteristics. We are also expanding our manufacturing operations globally while exploring ways to localize our vehicle designs and production for particular markets, including country-specific market demands and factory optimizations for local workforces. As we increase our capabilities, particularly in the areas of automation, die-making and line-building, we are also making strides in the simulations modeling these capabilities prior to construction. Energy Generation and Storage Our expertise in electrical, mechanical, civil and software engineering allows us to design and manufacture our energy generation and storage products and components. We also employ our design and engineering expertise to customize solutions including our energy storage products, solar energy systems and/or Solar Roof for customers to meet their specific needs. We have developed software that simplifies and expedites the design process and maximizes the energy production of each solar energy system, as well as mounting hardware that facilitates solar panel installation. Sales and Marketing Historically, we have been able to generate significant media coverage of our company and our products, and we believe we will continue to do so. Such media coverage and word of mouth are the current primary drivers of our sales leads and have helped us achieve sales without traditional advertising and at relatively low marketing costs. Automotive Direct Sales Our vehicle sales channels currently include our website and an international network of company-owned stores. In some jurisdictions, we also have galleries to educate and inform customers about our products, but such locations do not actually transact in the sale of vehicles. We believe this infrastructure enables us to better control costs of inventory, manage warranty service and pricing, educate consumers about electric vehicles, maintain and strengthen the Tesla brand and obtain rapid customer feedback. We reevaluate our sales strategy both globally and at a location-by-location level from time to time to optimize our current sales channels. Sales of vehicles in the automobile industry tend to be cyclical in many markets, which may expose us to volatility from time to time. Used Vehicle Sales Our used vehicle business supports new vehicle sales by integrating the trade-in of a customer s existing Tesla or non-Tesla vehicle with the sale of a new or used Tesla vehicle. The Tesla and non-Tesla vehicles we acquire as trade-ins are subsequently remarketed, either directly by us or through third parties. We also remarket used Tesla vehicles acquired from other sources including lease returns. Public Charging We have a growing global network of Tesla Superchargers, which are our industrial grade, high-speed vehicle chargers. Where possible, we co-locate Superchargers with our solar and energy storage systems to reduce costs and promote renewable power. Supercharger stations are typically placed along well-traveled routes and in and around dense city centers to allow Tesla vehicle owners the ability to enjoy quick, reliable and ubiquitous charging with convenient, minimal stops. Use of the Supercharger network either requires payment of a fee or is free under certain sales programs. 6 We also work with a wide variety of hospitality, retail and public destinations, as well as businesses with commuting employees, to offer additional charging options for our customers. These Destination Charging and workplace locations deploy Tesla Wall Connectors to provide charging to Tesla vehicle owners who patronize or are employed at their businesses. We also work with single-family homeowners and multi-family residential entities to deploy home charging solutions. In-App Upgrades As our vehicles are capable of being updated remotely over-the-air, our customers may purchase additional paid options and features through the Tesla app. We expect that this functionality will also allow us to offer certain options and features on a subscription basis in the future. Energy Generation and Storage We market and sell our solar and energy storage products to residential, commercial and industrial customers and utilities through a variety of channels. We emphasize simplicity, standardization and accessibility to make it easy and cost-effective for customers to adopt clean energy, while reducing our customer acquisition costs. In the U.S., we offer residential solar and energy storage products directly through our website, stores and galleries, as well as through our network of channel partners. Outside of the U.S., we use our international sales organization and a network of channel partners to market and sell these products for the residential market. We also sell Powerwall directly to utilities. In the case of products sold to utilities or channel partners, such partners typically sell the product and manage the installation in customer homes. We sell our commercial and utility-scale energy storage systems to customers through our U.S. and international sales organization and our channel partner network. In certain jurisdictions, we also sell installed solar energy systems (with or without energy storage) to commercial customers through cash, lease and PPA transactions. Service and Warranty Automotive Service We provide service for our electric vehicles at our company-owned service locations and through Tesla Mobile Service technicians who perform work remotely at customers homes or other locations. Performing vehicle service ourselves provides us with the capability to identify problems and implement solutions and improvements faster, and optimize logistics and inventory better, than traditional automobile manufacturers and their dealer networks. The connectivity of our vehicles also allows us to diagnose and remedy many problems remotely and proactively. Vehicle Limited Warranties and Extended Service Plans We provide a manufacturer s limited warranty on all new and used Tesla vehicles we sell, which may include separate limited warranties on certain components, specific types of damage or battery capacity retention. We also currently offer extended service plans that provide coverage beyond the new vehicle limited warranties for certain models in specified regions. Energy Generation and Storage We provide service and repairs to our energy product customers, including under warranty where applicable. Energy Storage Systems We generally provide manufacturer s limited warranties with every new energy storage product and offer certain extended limited warranties that are available at the time of purchase of the system. If we install a system, we also provide certain limited warranties on our installation workmanship. As part of our energy storage system contracts, we may provide the customer with performance guarantees that warrant that the underlying system will meet or exceed the minimum energy performance requirements specified in the contract. Solar Energy Systems For retrofit solar energy systems, we provide separate limited warranties for workmanship and against roof leaks, and for Solar Roof, we provide limited warranties for defects and weatherization. For components not manufactured by us, we generally pass-through the applicable manufacturers warranties. As part of our solar energy system contracts, we may provide the customer with performance guarantees that warrant that the underlying system will meet or exceed the minimum energy generation requirements specified in the contract. 7 Financial Services Automotive Purchase Financing and Leases We offer leasing and/or loan financing arrangements for our vehicles in certain jurisdictions in North America, Europe and Asia through various financial institutions. Under certain of such programs, we have provided resale value guarantees or buyback guarantees that may obligate us to repurchase the subject vehicles at pre-determined values. We also offer vehicle financing arrangements in certain markets for specified vehicle models directly through our local subsidiaries. Insurance In August 2019, we launched an insurance product designed for our customers, which offers rates that are often better than other alternatives. This product is currently available in California, and we plan to expand both the markets in which we offer insurance products and our ability to offer such products, as part of our ongoing effort to decrease the total cost of ownership for our customers. Energy Generation and Storage Energy Storage Systems We currently offer certain loan, lease and/or PPA options to residential or commercial customers who pair energy storage systems with solar energy systems. We intend to introduce financial services offerings for customers who purchase standalone energy storage products in the future. Solar Energy Systems We offer various financing options to our solar customers. Our solar loan offers third-party financing to enable the customer to purchase and own a solar energy system. We are not a party to the loan agreement, and the third-party lender has no recourse against us with respect to the loan. Our solar lease offers customers a fixed monthly fee at rates that typically translate into lower monthly utility bills and an electricity production guarantee. Our solar PPA charges customers a fee per kilowatt-hour based on the amount of electricity produced by our solar energy systems. We monetize the customer payments we receive from our leases and PPAs through funds we have formed with investors. We also intend to introduce financial services offerings for our Solar Roof customers in the future. Manufacturing Manufacturing Facilities in the Bay Area, California We manufacture and test our vehicles at our manufacturing facilities in the Bay Area in California, including the Fremont Factory and other local manufacturing facilities. We also manufacture and develop certain parts and components that are critical to our intellectual property and quality standards, such as Model S and Model X battery packs and our proprietary lithium-ion battery cells, at these locations. Gigafactory Nevada near Reno, Nevada We have integrated battery material, cell, module and battery pack production for Model 3, Model Y and our energy products in one location at Gigafactory Nevada. In addition, we manufacture vehicle drive units and our energy storage products there. Gigafactory Nevada allows us to access high volumes of lithium-ion battery cells manufactured by our partner Panasonic there while achieving a significant reduction in the cost of our battery packs. We continue to invest in Gigafactory Nevada to achieve additional output there, including through our agreement with Panasonic. Gigafactory New York in Buffalo, New York We use Gigafactory New York for the development and production of our Solar Roof and other solar products and components, energy storage components and Supercharger components, and for other lessor-approved functions. Gigafactory Shanghai in China We established Gigafactory Shanghai to increase the affordability of our vehicles for customers in local markets by reducing transportation and manufacturing costs and eliminating the impact of unfavorable tariffs. We continue to increase the degree of localized procurement and manufacturing there. Gigafactory Shanghai is representative of our plan to iteratively improve our manufacturing operations as we establish new factories, as we implemented the learnings from our Model 3 ramp at the Fremont Factory to commence and ramp our production there quickly and cost-effectively. 8 Other Manufacturing Generally, we continue to expand production capacity at our existing facilities. We also intend to further increase cost-competitiveness in our significant markets by strategically adding local manufacturing, including at Gigafactory Berlin in Germany and Gigafactory Texas in Austin, Texas, which are under construction. Supply Chain Our products use thousands of purchased parts that are sourced from hundreds of suppliers across the world. We have developed close relationships with vendors of key parts such as battery cells, electronics and complex vehicle assemblies. Certain components purchased from these suppliers are shared or are similar across many product lines, allowing us to take advantage of pricing efficiencies from economies of scale. As is the case for most automotive companies, most of our procured components and systems are sourced from single suppliers. Where multiple sources are available for certain key components, we work to qualify multiple suppliers for them where it is sensible to do so in order to minimize production risks owing to disruptions in their supply. We also mitigate risk by maintaining safety stock for key parts and assemblies and die banks for components with lengthy procurement lead times. Our products use various raw materials including aluminum, steel, cobalt, lithium, nickel and copper. Pricing for these materials is governed by market conditions and may fluctuate due to various factors outside of our control, such as supply and demand and market speculation. We strive to execute long-term supply contracts for such materials at competitive pricing when feasible, and we currently believe that we have adequate access to raw materials supplies in order to meet the needs of our operations. Governmental Programs, Incentives and Regulations Globally, both the operation of our business by us and the ownership of our products by our customers are impacted by various government programs, incentives and other arrangements. Our business and products are also subject to numerous governmental regulations that vary among jurisdictions. Programs and Incentives California Alternative Energy and Advanced Transportation Financing Authority Tax Incentives We have agreements with the California Alternative Energy and Advanced Transportation Financing Authority that provide multi-year sales tax exclusions on purchases of manufacturing equipment that will be used for specific purposes, including the expansion and ongoing development of electric vehicles and powertrain production in California. Gigafactory Nevada Nevada Tax Incentives In connection with the construction of Gigafactory Nevada, we entered into agreements with the State of Nevada and Storey County in Nevada that provide abatements for specified taxes, discounts to the base tariff energy rates and transferable tax credits in consideration of capital investment and hiring targets that were met at Gigafactory Nevada. These incentives are available until June 2024 or June 2034, depending on the incentive. Gigafactory New York New York State Investment and Lease We have a lease through the Research Foundation for the State University of New York (the SUNY Foundation with respect to Gigafactory New York. Under the lease and a related research and development agreement, we are continuing to designate further buildouts at the facility. We are required to comply with certain covenants, including hiring and cumulative investment targets. As we temporarily suspended most of our manufacturing operations at Gigafactory New York pursuant to a New York State executive order issued in March 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we were granted a one-year deferral of our obligation to be compliant with our applicable targets under such agreement on April 30, 2020, which was memorialized in an amendment to our agreement with the SUNY Foundation in July 2020. Gigafactory Shanghai Land Use Rights and Economic Benefits We have an agreement with the local government of Shanghai for land use rights at Gigafactory Shanghai. Under the terms of the arrangement, we are required to meet a cumulative capital expenditure target and an annual tax revenue target starting at the end of 2023. In addition, the Shanghai government has granted to our Gigafactory Shanghai subsidiary in 2019 and 2020 certain incentives to be used in connection with eligible capital investments at Gigafactory Shanghai. Finally, the Shanghai government granted a beneficial corporate income tax rate of 15 to certain eligible enterprises, which is lower than the 25 statutory corporate income tax rate in China. Our Gigafactory Shanghai subsidiary was granted this lower rate for 2019 through 2023. 9 Gigafactory Berlin Pending Grant We have applied for a grant with the German government to improve the design, chemistry, manufacturing technology and recycling of lithium-ion battery cells for Gigafactory Berlin. The grant was approved by the European Commission in January 2021 and its implementation will be subject to a grant agreement with the German government. Gigafactory Texas Tax Incentives In connection with the construction of Gigafactory Texas, we entered into a 20-year agreement with Travis County in Texas pursuant to which we would receive grant funding equal to 70-80 of property taxes paid by us to Travis County and a separate 10-year agreement with the Del Valle Independent School District in Texas pursuant to which a portion of the taxable value of our property would be capped at a specified amount, in each case subject to our meeting certain minimum economic development metrics through our construction and operations at Gigafactory Texas. Regulatory Credits We earn tradable credits in the operation of our business under various regulations related to zero-emission vehicles ZEVs ), greenhouse gas, fuel economy, renewable energy and clean fuel. We sell these credits to other regulated entities who can use the credits to comply with emission standards, renewable energy procurement standards and other regulatory requirements. Energy Storage System Incentives and Policies While the regulatory regime for energy storage projects is still under development, there are various policies, incentives and financial mechanisms at the federal, state and local levels that support the adoption of energy storage. For example, energy storage systems that are charged using solar energy may be eligible for the solar energy-related U.S. federal tax credits described below. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC has also taken steps to enable the participation of energy storage in wholesale energy markets. In addition, California and a number of other states have adopted procurement targets for energy storage, and behind-the-meter energy storage systems qualify for funding under the California Self Generation Incentive Program. Solar Energy System Incentives and Policies U.S. federal, state and local governments have established various policies, incentives and financial mechanisms to reduce the cost of solar energy and to accelerate the adoption of solar energy. These incentives include tax credits, cash grants, tax abatements and rebates. In particular, Sections 48 and 25D of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code currently provide a tax credit of 26 of qualified commercial or residential expenditures for solar energy systems, which may be claimed by our customers for systems they purchase, or by us for arrangements where we own the systems. These tax credits are currently scheduled to decline and/or expire in 2023 and beyond. Regulations Vehicle Safety and Testing In the U.S., our vehicles are subject to regulation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration NHTSA ), including all applicable Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards FMVSS and the NHTSA bumper standard. Numerous FMVSS apply to our vehicles, such as crash-worthiness requirements, crash avoidance requirements and electric vehicle requirements. While our current vehicles fully comply and we expect that our vehicles in the future will fully comply with all applicable FMVSS with limited or no exemptions, FMVSS are subject to change from time to time. As a manufacturer, we must self-certify that our vehicles meet all applicable FMVSS and the NHTSA bumper standard, or otherwise are exempt, before the vehicles may be imported or sold in the U.S. We are also required to comply with other federal laws administered by NHTSA, including the CAFE standards, Theft Prevention Act requirements, consumer information labeling requirements, Early Warning Reporting requirements regarding warranty claims, field reports, death and injury reports and foreign recalls, owner s manual requirements and additional requirements for cooperating with safety investigations and defect and recall reporting. The U.S. Automobile Information and Disclosure Act also requires manufacturers of motor vehicles to disclose certain information regarding the manufacturer s suggested retail price, optional equipment and pricing. In addition, federal law requires inclusion of fuel economy ratings, as determined by the U.S. Department of Transportation and the Environmental Protection Agency (the EPA ), and 5-star safety ratings as determined by NHTSA, if available. 10 Our vehicles sold outside of the U.S. are subject to similar foreign safety, environmental and other regulations. Many of those regulations are different from those applicable in the U.S. and may require redesign and/or retesting . Some of those regulations impact or prevent the rollout of new vehicle features. Additionally, t he European Union has established new rules regarding additional compliance oversight that commence d in 2020, and there is also regulatory uncertainty related to the United Kingdom s withdrawal from the European Union. Self-Driving Vehicles Generally, laws pertaining to self-driving vehicles are evolving globally, and in some cases may create restrictions on self-driving features that we develop. While there are currently no federal U.S. regulations specifically pertaining to self-driving vehicles or self-driving equipment, NHTSA has published recommended guidelines on self-driving vehicles, and retains the authority to investigate and/or take action on the safety of any vehicle, equipment or features operating on public roads. Certain U.S. states have legal restrictions on the operation, registration or licensure of self-driving vehicles, and many other states are considering them. This regulatory patchwork increases the legal complexity with respect to self-driving vehicles in the U.S. In markets that follow the regulations of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, some requirements restrict the design of advanced driver-assistance or self-driving features, which can compromise or prevent their use entirely. Other applicable laws, both current and proposed, may hinder the path and timeline to introducing self-driving vehicles for sale and use in the markets where they apply. Other key markets, including China, continue to consider self-driving regulation. Any implemented regulations may differ materially from those in the U.S. and Europe, which may further increase the legal complexity of self-driving vehicles and limit or prevent certain features. Automobile Manufacturer and Dealer Regulation In the U.S., state laws regulate the manufacture, distribution, sale and service of automobiles, and generally require motor vehicle manufacturers and dealers to be licensed in order to sell vehicles directly to residents. Certain states have asserted that the laws in such states do not permit automobile manufacturers to be licensed as dealers or to act in the capacity of a dealer, or that they otherwise restrict a manufacturer s ability to deliver or service vehicles. To sell vehicles to residents of states where we are not licensed as a dealer, we generally conduct the transfer of title out of the state. In certain such states, we have opened galleries that serve an educational purpose and where the title transfer may not occur. Some automobile dealer trade associations have both challenged the legality of our operations in court and used administrative and legislative processes to attempt to prohibit or limit our ability to operate existing stores or expand to new locations. Certain dealer associations have also actively lobbied state licensing agencies and legislators to interpret existing laws or enact new laws in ways not favorable to our ownership and operation of our own retail and service locations. We expect such challenges to continue, and we intend to actively fight any such efforts. Battery Safety and Testing Our battery packs are subject to various U.S. and international regulations that govern transport of dangerous goods, defined to include lithium-ion batteries, which may present a risk in transportation. We conduct testing to demonstrate our compliance with such regulations. We use lithium-ion cells in our high voltage battery packs in our vehicles and energy storage products. The use, storage and disposal of our battery packs are regulated under existing laws and are the subject of ongoing regulatory changes that may add additional requirements in the future. We have agreements with third party battery recycling companies to recycle our battery packs and we are also piloting our own recycling technology. Solar Energy General We are not a regulated utility in the U.S., although we are subject to certain state and federal regulations applicable to solar and battery storage providers. To operate our systems, we enter into standard interconnection agreements with applicable utilities. Sales of electricity and non-sale equipment leases by third parties, such as our leases, PPAs and subscription agreements, have faced regulatory challenges in some states and jurisdictions. Solar Energy Net Metering Most states in the U.S. make net energy metering, or net metering, available to solar customers. Net metering typically allows solar customers to interconnect their solar energy systems to the utility grid and offset their utility electricity purchases by receiving a bill credit for excess energy generated by their solar energy system that is exported to the grid. In certain jurisdictions, regulators or utilities have reduced or eliminated the benefit available under net metering or have proposed to do so. 11 Competition Automotive The worldwide automotive market is highly competitive and we expect it will become even more competitive in the future as we introduce additional vehicles in a broader cross-section of the passenger and commercial vehicle market and expand our vehicles capabilities. We believe that our vehicles compete in the market both based on their traditional segment classification as well as based on their propulsion technology. For example, Model S and Model X compete primarily with premium sedans and premium SUVs and Model 3 and Model Y compete with small to medium-sized sedans and compact SUVs, which are extremely competitive markets. Competing products typically include internal combustion vehicles from more established automobile manufacturers however, many established and new automobile manufacturers have entered or have announced plans to enter the market for electric and other alternative fuel vehicles. Overall, we believe these announcements and vehicle introductions promote the development of the electric vehicle market by highlighting the attractiveness of electric vehicles relative to the internal combustion vehicle. Many major automobile manufacturers have electric vehicles available today in major markets including the U.S., China and Europe, and other current and prospective automobile manufacturers are also developing electric vehicles. In addition, several manufacturers offer hybrid vehicles, including plug-in versions. We also believe that there is increasing competition for our vehicle offerings as a platform for delivering self-driving technologies, charging solutions and other features and services, and we expect to compete in this developing market through continued progress on our Autopilot, FSD and neural network capabilities, Supercharger network and our infotainment offerings. Energy Generation and Storage Energy Storage Systems The market for energy storage products is also highly competitive, and both established and emerging companies have introduced products that are similar to our product portfolio or that are alternatives to the elements of our systems. We compete with these companies based on price, energy density and efficiency. We believe that the specifications and features of our products, our strong brand and the modular, scalable nature of our energy storage products give us a competitive advantage in our markets. Solar Energy Systems The primary competitors to our solar energy business are the traditional local utility companies that supply energy to our potential customers. We compete with these traditional utility companies primarily based on price and the ease by which customers can switch to electricity generated by our solar energy systems. We also compete with solar energy companies that provide products and services similar to ours. Many solar energy companies only install solar energy systems, while others only provide financing for these installations. We believe we have a significant expansion opportunity with our offerings and that the regulatory environment is increasingly conducive to the adoption of renewable energy systems. Intellectual Property We place a strong emphasis on our innovative approach and proprietary designs which bring intrinsic value and uniqueness to our product portfolio. As part of our business, we seek to protect the underlying intellectual property rights of these innovations and designs such as with respect to patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and other measures, including through employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements and other contractual arrangements. For example, we place a high priority on obtaining patents to provide the broadest and strongest possible protection to enable our freedom to operate our innovations and designs within our products and technologies in the electric vehicle market as well as to protect and defend our product portfolio. We have also adopted a patent policy in which we irrevocably pledged that we will not initiate a lawsuit against any party for infringing our patents through activity relating to electric vehicles or related equipment for so long as such party is acting in good faith. We made this pledge in order to encourage the advancement of a common, rapidly-evolving platform for electric vehicles, thereby benefiting ourselves, other companies making electric vehicles and the world. Human Capital Resources As of December 31, 2020, our full-time count for our and our subsidiaries employees worldwide was 70,757. To date, we have not experienced any work stoppages as a result of labor disputes, and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good. Our key human capital objectives in managing our business include attracting, developing and retaining top talent while integrating diversity, equity and inclusion principles and practices into our core values. 12 We want to attract a pool of diverse and exceptional candidates and support their career growth once they become employees. Our efforts begin at the entry level with development, apprenticeship and internship programs in local high schools, community colleges and four-year colleges . In addition, we seek to hire based on talent rather than solely on educational pedigree, and have provided thousands of job openings , including in our local communities, for capable workers from various backgrounds to learn valuable skills in critical operations such as in manufacturing, vehicle service and energy product installation . We also emphasize in our evaluation and career development efforts internal mobility opportunities for employees to drive professional development. Our goal is a long-term, upward-bound career at Tesla for every employee , which we believe also drives our retention efforts . We also believe that our ability to retain our workforce is dependent on our ability to foster an environment that is sustainably safe, respectful, fair and inclusive of everyone and promotes diversity, equity and inclusion inside and outside of our business. From our outreach to Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Hispanic Serving Institutions to sponsoring employee resource groups across numerous locations, including Asian Pacific Islanders at Tesla, Black at Tesla, Intersectionality, Latinos at Tesla, LGBTQ at Tesla, Veterans at Tesla and Women in Tesla, we engage these networks as key business resources and sources of actionable feedback. We are also working on diversity efforts in our supply chain to expand our outreach and support to small- and large-scale suppliers from underrepresented communities to emphasize this culture with our own employees.

            "ITEM 1. BUSINESS Overview Our goal is to slow the progression of chronic kidney disease, or CKD, through the treatment of metabolic acidosis. We are a pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of our investigational drug candidate, veverimer (also known as TRC101), a non-absorbed, orally-administered polymer designed to treat metabolic acidosis by binding and removing acid from the gastrointestinal, or GI, tract. Metabolic acidosis is a serious condition commonly caused by CKD and is believed to accelerate the progression of kidney deterioration. It can also lead to bone loss, muscle wasting and impaired physical function. Metabolic acidosis in patients with CKD is typically a chronic disease and, as such, requires long-term treatment to mitigate its deleterious consequences. There are currently no FDA-approved therapies for treating chronic metabolic acidosis. We estimate that metabolic acidosis affects approximately 3 million patients with CKD in the United States, and we believe that treating metabolic acidosis and slowing the progression of CKD in patients with metabolic acidosis and CKD represents a significant unmet medical need and market opportunity. Veverimer is an in-house discovered, new chemical entity. We have a broad intellectual property estate that we believe will provide patent protection for veverimer until at least 2038 in the United States, at least 2035 in Europe and Russia, and at least 2034 in Australia, China, Hong Kong, Israel, Japan, Mexico and certain other markets. Metabolic acidosis observed in patients with CKD is most often caused by an imbalance in acid production relative to acid excretion. The human body generates acid every day through normal food intake and metabolism. Sources of acid include amino acids and nucleic acids from daily dietary intake and digestion of proteins. The daily load of nonvolatile acids from metabolic processes amounts to approximately 1 milliequivalent, or mEq, per kilogram, or kg, of body weight, or 50 to 100 mEq per day for adults. A healthy kidney excretes this acid daily, but in patients with CKD acid excretion is compromised, and as a result, acid accumulates in the body. Over time, a vicious cycle of worsening metabolic acidosis and accelerated progression of kidney disease can result. Patients with CKD are often frail and have impaired physical function, and metabolic acidosis is one factor that has been implicated as a potential contributor. Metabolic acidosis has direct effects on skeletal muscle catabolism and bone demineralization. Two large retrospective cohort analyses found that low serum bicarbonate level was independently associated with adverse health outcomes related to physical functioning, such as gait speed, quadriceps strength, failure to thrive and fractures/falls (Abramowitz et al., 2011; Reaven et al., 2019). Several prospective studies of patients with metabolic acidosis and CKD have shown that treatment of metabolic acidosis can increase muscle mass (de Brito-Ashurst et al., 2009; Dubey et al., 2018) and improve muscle function (Abramowitz et al., 2013) and physical function related quality of life (de Brito-Ashurst et al., 2015). Acid binding in the GI tract is a novel approach to treating metabolic acidosis without introducing deleterious counterions or metals. This approach mimics the physiologic response to acid removal seen with persistent vomiting or nasogastric suction that results in an elevated serum bicarbonate level. To achieve the desired effect of increasing serum bicarbonate with a convenient daily dose of less than 10 grams per day, an acid binding polymer should have an amine capacity to bind at least 5 mEq of proton/gram. Once protonated, the acid binding polymer needs to preserve the effect of the proton binding by not removing anions such as fatty and bile acids that represent precursors metabolized to bicarbonate in the blood. The complementary anion to be bound that ensures net acid removal from the GI tract is chloride, the smallest anion present in the GI tract. Veverimer is a low-swelling, spherical polymer bead that is approximately 100 micrometers in diameter. It is a single, high molecular weight, crosslinked polyamine molecule. The size of veverimer prevents systemic absorption from the GI tract. The high degree of cross-linking within veverimer limits swelling and the overall volume in the GI tract, with the goal of facilitating good GI tolerability. The high amine content of veverimer provides proton binding capacity of approximately 10 mEq/gram of polymer. The size exclusion built into the three-dimensional structure of the polymer enables preferential binding of chloride versus larger inorganic and organic anions, including phosphate, citrate, fatty acids and bile acids. This size exclusion mechanism allows a majority of the binding capacity to be used for hydrochloric acid binding. We are currently conducting a renal outcomes clinical trial, VALOR-CKD (also known as TRCA-303), to determine if veverimer slows CKD progression in patients with metabolic acidosis associated with CKD. Our VALOR-CKD trial is a 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, time-to-event trial. The primary endpoint event in VALOR-CKD is defined as renal death, end-stage renal disease, or ESRD, or a confirmed 40 reduction in estimated glomerular filtration rate, or eGFR, which is also known as DD40. We anticipate randomizing approximately 1,600 subjects in VALOR-CKD and the trial is currently designed to terminate when the independent blinded Clinical Endpoint Adjudication Committee has positively adjudicated 511 subjects with primary endpoint events, which is anticipated to occur in the first half of 2024. The VALOR-CKD trial also includes two interim analyses for early stopping for efficacy after the accrual of 150 primary endpoint events, which is anticipated in the second half of 2021, and 250 primary endpoint events, which is anticipated in mid-2022, based on the current rate of event accrual. These interim analyses will be conducted by an independent unblinded Interim Analysis Committee. If the independent unblinded Interim Analysis Committee does not recommend stopping the trial early for efficacy, we will receive no information from these interim analyses. The VALOR-CKD trial also includes, as its first two secondary efficacy endpoints, evaluation of the effect of veverimer versus placebo after one year of treatment on patient-reported and objective measures of physical functioning, using self-reported responses to the physical function subpart of the Kidney Disease and Quality of Life Short Form, or KDQOL Physical Functioning Survey, and the Repeated Chair Stand test, respectively. Although not part of any efficacy endpoints, the VALOR-CKD trial will also provide information regarding the change from baseline in serum bicarbonate in veverimer and placebo-treated subjects. In November 2020, Tricida revised the protocol for the VALOR-CKD trial based on feedback from the FDA in a July 2020 advice letter as well as our additional work to understand both the hazard ratio and the anticipated serum bicarbonate effect of veverimer. In collaboration with Dr. Navdeep Tangri, M.D., Ph.D. (University of Manitoba, Canada), we developed a time-dependent predictive model, or the Time-Dependent Predictive Model, in a cohort of more than 24,000 U.S. patients with metabolic acidosis and CKD. The results from this model show an 8.4 lower risk of CKD progression for each 1 mEq/L increase in serum bicarbonate. In addition, we believe the magnitude of the veverimer treatment effect in the TRCA-301/TRCA-301E trial is best described by the between-group difference in the medians, rather than the difference in the LS means, as the data are not normally distributed. The Week 52 median placebo-subtracted treatment effect in the TRCA-301E trial was an increase in serum bicarbonate of 3.15 mEq/L. Based on a median treatment effect of 3.15 mEq/L and using the Time-Dependent Predictive Model, we assume a hazard ratio of 0.76 for the VALOR-CKD trial. Based on this assumed hazard ratio, with a sample size of 1,600 subjects, the trial has 87 power to show a 24 difference in primary endpoint events. While we have not yet received comments from the FDA on the revised protocol, we believe that VALOR-CKD is adequately designed and powered to confirm the clinical benefit of veverimer treatment in slowing CKD progression. We initiated enrollment in the VALOR-CKD trial in the fourth quarter of 2018 and have established sites throughout North America, Europe, Latin America and Asia-Pacific. As of February 22, 2021, the VALOR-CKD trial has randomized 1,433 of 1,600 subjects with an average treatment duration of approximately one year and has accrued 69 subjects with positively adjudicated primary endpoint events. In November 2020, based on feedback from the FDA, recruitment for VALOR-CKD was closed in all regions except for the United States, Canada and Western Europe. At the end of recruitment, we anticipate approximately 67 of subjects to be enrolled at Eastern European sites, 19 at U.S., Western European and Canadian sites, 7 at Latin American sites, and 7 at sites in the Asia-Pacific region. Our goal is to complete enrollment by the end of 2021; to meet this goal we may need to reopen recruitment at sites outside of the United States, but we will not reopen recruitment at sites in Eastern Europe. We intend to ensure that no single site in the VALOR-CKD trial provides 5 of the total number of trial subjects. The FDA s acceptance of the VALOR-CKD data in support of an NDA resubmission, including its assessment of the magnitude and durability of the veverimer treatment effect across the various geographical regions where the study is conducted and the acceptability of the data from non-US countries or regions which will comprise a substantial proportion of the data from the trial, will ultimately be a review issue. We completed our Phase 3, 12-week efficacy trial, TRCA-301, and a follow-on 40-week extension trial, TRCA-301E in May 2018 and March 2019, respectively. The TRCA-301/TRCA-301E trial was designed to form the primary clinical basis for the potential approval of veverimer for the treatment for metabolic acidosis and slowing of kidney disease progression in patients with metabolic acidosis associated with CKD pursuant to the FDA's Accelerated Approval Program. The Lancet published the results of the TRCA-301 trial in March 2019 and the results of the TRCA-301E trial in June 2019. The TRCA-301 trial was a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that randomized 217 patients with non-dialysis dependent CKD and metabolic acidosis. The primary and secondary efficacy endpoints of the trial assessed changes in serum bicarbonate levels in veverimer-treated patients versus placebo. Chronic metabolic acidosis in CKD is characterized by a persistent serum bicarbonate level below 22 mEq/L. After 12 weeks of treatment, 59.2 of subjects in the veverimer-treated group, compared with 22.5 of subjects in the placebo group, had an increase in serum 4 bicarbonate level of at least 4 mEq/L or achieved a serum bicarbonate level in the normal range of 22 to 29 mEq/L, which was the primary endpoint of the trial. The secondary endpoint of the trial, the least squares, or LS, mean change from baseline to week 12 in serum bicarbonate, was 4.42 mEq/L in the veverimer-treated group, compared with 1.78 mEq/L in the placebo group. The mean change in serum bicarbonate from baseline to week 12 was 4.5 mEq/L in the veverimer-treated group, compared with 1.7 mEq/L in the placebo group. The trial met both its primary and secondary endpoints in a highly statistically significant manner (p that the findings for TRCA-301, and its extension, TRCA-301E, were driven by a single, high-enrolling trial site located in Eastern Europe. The CRL did not raise any concerns related to FDA s completed inspection of the highest enrolling clinical trial site in the TRCA-301/TRCA-301E trial and there was no FDA Form 483 issued. There were no safety, clinical pharmacology/biopharmaceutics, CMC, or non-clinical issues identified in the CRL. The CRL provided multiple options for resolving the identified deficiencies, including submission of the data from at least one additional adequate and well-controlled trial demonstrating the efficacy of veverimer for the treatment of metabolic acidosis associated with CKD. We held an End-of-Review Type A meeting, or Type A meeting, with the FDA's Division of Cardiology and Nephrology, or the Division, in October 2020. The Division agreed, in principle, that an interim analysis of serum bicarbonate data from the VALOR-CKD trial proposed by Tricida could address the Division's concerns regarding the reliability of the TRCA-301/TRCA-301E trial data and the relevance of those trial findings to the U.S. population provided certain conditions were met. Based on other feedback from the FDA during the Type A meeting, we believed the Division would also require evidence of veverimer's effect on CKD progression from a near-term interim analysis of the VALOR-CKD trial for accelerated approval and that the FDA would be unlikely to rely solely on serum bicarbonate data for determination of efficacy. Accordingly, we submitted a Formal Dispute Resolution Request, or FDRR, solely requesting that the Office of New Drugs, or OND, find that the magnitude of serum bicarbonate change seen in the TRCA-301/TRCA-301E trial is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit in the treatment of metabolic acidosis associated with CKD and that it can therefore serve as the basis for accelerated approval. In February 2021, the OND issued a decision on our FDRR. While the OND acknowledged that the TRCA-301 and TRCA-301E trials met their serum bicarbonate endpoints with statistical significance, the OND denied the appeal. In its Appeal Denied Letter, or ADL, the OND not only addressed the issue of magnitude of serum bicarbonate change, but cited all of the deficiencies in the CRL in concluding that the data provided in support of the veverimer NDA did not support approval through the Accelerated Approval Program. The OND concluded that the magnitude of the increases in serum bicarbonate levels shown in the TRCA-301/TRCA-301E trial were not of sufficient size or duration to establish that treatment with veverimer would be reasonably likely to provide a discernible reduction in CKD progression. In addition, the OND found that the intended confirmatory trial, VALOR-CKD, was underpowered to detect a 13 reduction in slowing of CKD progression. This finding was based on information included in the initial NDA submission, including the placebo-subtracted LS mean change from baseline in serum bicarbonate observed in the TRCA-301/TRCA-301E trial and the original Predictive MA Model. The OND also raised concerns regarding the robustness of the study results given that the veverimer NDA was supported by a single registrational trial (TRCA-301/TRCA-301E), which must, alone, provide persuasive evidence of benefit. Specifically, the OND noted concerns around adequate blinding, the trial results being strongly influenced by a single site, and the majority of sites for the TRCA-301/TRCA-301E trial being in Eastern Europe, where differences in patient management, including concomitant medications and diet, might affect the treatment response to veverimer and raise a concern of the applicability to a U.S. patient population. The OND also stated that, while trial results in the TRCA-301/TRCA-301E trial showed improvement in two patient-reported measures, the KDQOL Physical Functioning Survey and the Repeated Chair Stand Test, the OND viewed this subjective data from a single trial with skepticism in the absence of data from a second trial with similar results and noted that both endpoints would require rigorous blinding to support robust conclusions. However, the OND noted that both of these changes, if eventually established by one or more additional trials, would indicate a potentially meaningful benefit of veverimer treatment especially in CKD patients who have physical functional impairments. Separate from the ADL, we previously received feedback from the Division of Clinical Outcome Assessment, or DCOA, that reliance on these physical function endpoints for approval may require further validation. Based on the ADL, we believe that we now have greater clarity on the potential approval of veverimer through the Accelerated Approval Program. The OND suggested that we meet with the Division to discuss submission of Week 52 serum bicarbonate results from the full randomized trial population of VALOR-CKD and that the trial should include a substantial portion of patients from the United States or from regions with US-like patients. If the results of this trial were to demonstrate that veverimer provides a meaningfully larger treatment effect than seen in the TRCA-301/TRCA-301E trial, then this trial, along with the results from the TRCA-301/TRCA-301E trial, could address the concerns raised in the CRL regarding the limitations and the size of the treatment response observed in the TRCA-301/TRCA-301E trial. However, whether the extent of increase in serum bicarbonate in any subsequent submission based on VALOR-CKD would support accelerated approval will remain a review issue, and will, in part, reflect the Division s assessment of the adequacy (i.e., power) of VALOR-CKD to detect the anticipated treatment effect of CKD progression in a reasonable timeframe. Although the ADL provides greater clarity on the potential path for approval of veverimer through the Accelerated Approval Program, we believe the timeline to meet the requirements for accelerated approval as suggested in the ADL, 6 may not result in the most rapid development path for veverimer. For example, if either of the planned interim analyses in VALOR-CKD for early stopping for efficacy results in positive renal outcomes data, this data could be available before the week 52 serum bicarbonate data from the fully enrolled VALOR-CKD trial suggested in the ADL and could serve as the basis for resubmission of the NDA. We are evaluating several options with respect to the VALOR-CKD trial that are focused on obtaining, prior to the end of 2022, additional data on the effect of veverimer on (1) CKD progression; (2) physical functioning; and (3) serum bicarbonate. We may explore the possibility of stopping the trial early for administrative reasons, which would allow analysis of the data using all alpha remaining at that time. In any event, we believe data from VALOR-CKD will be very important in furthering our understanding of the regulatory path for approval of veverimer. As such, we intend to continue the execution of the VALOR-CKD trial with consideration of both the accelerated and traditional approval pathways. Resubmission of the veverimer NDA may require additional clinical data beyond that provided by the VALOR-CKD trial. There is a high unmet medical need for an FDA-approved chronic treatment for metabolic acidosis in patients with CKD, and a broad understanding among nephrologists that treatment of metabolic acidosis can slow CKD progression. We believe that the favorable response from nephrologists to veverimer s target product profile and the potential health and economic benefits from treating metabolic acidosis provide a significant opportunity for veverimer in the U.S. market, if approved, as the first and only FDA-approved therapy for the treatment of chronic metabolic acidosis and slowing of kidney disease progression and/or improving physical functioning in patients with metabolic acidosis and CKD. Our Strategy Our strategy is to develop and commercialize veverimer as the first and only FDA-approved therapy for the treatment of chronic metabolic acidosis in patients with CKD. Key elements of our strategy are to: Obtain FDA approval of veverimer through the Accelerated Approval Program based upon veverimer s effect on serum bicarbonate or traditional approval based upon veverimer s effect on slowing CKD progression and/or on improving physical functioning in patients with metabolic acidosis associated with CKD. Expand awareness of, and educate nephrologists on, the consequences of untreated metabolic acidosis in patients with CKD. We have authored and co-authored 24 and sponsored 23 peer-reviewed publications or presentations in the past two years that highlight veverimer, the serious complications of metabolic acidosis and its economic burden to the healthcare system. We have provided continuing medical education, or CME, grants related to disease awareness and treatment of metabolic acidosis and have built an educational website, MetabolicAcidosisInsights.com, for nephrologists and healthcare providers that offers resources and information related to metabolic acidosis. Commercialize veverimer in the United States. If veverimer is approved by the FDA, we plan to initially commercialize it in the United States by deploying an 80- to 90-person specialty sales force targeting that subset of nephrologists most focused on treating patients with CKD. With this approach, we believe we can reach a majority of the approximately 600,000 patients with metabolic acidosis and Stage 3 to 5 CKD that are cared for by nephrologists. Alternatively, we may seek to commercialize veverimer in the United States with one or more partners. Commercialize veverimer outside of the United States with one or more partners. We believe there is a significant commercial opportunity for veverimer in markets outside the United States. To address these markets, we plan to seek one or more partners with international sales expertise who can commercialize veverimer in target markets, if approved. Chronic Kidney Disease and Metabolic Acidosis Represent a Major Health Crisis Overview of CKD CKD is a serious condition characterized by the gradual loss of essential kidney functions over time. In patients with CKD, normal fluid and electrolyte balance can no longer be maintained, and the excretion of metabolic end products, toxins and drugs is impaired. Furthermore, production and secretion of certain enzymes and hormones are disturbed. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, more than 37 million people in the United States are afflicted with CKD, representing an overall prevalence in the adult population of approximately 15 . The incidence of CKD is primarily driven by the increasing prevalence of diabetes and hypertension. The treatment of CKD adds a tremendous financial burden to the United States, with annual Medicare expenses for CKD in 2018 totaling 7 approximately 131.0 billion, including approximately 81.8 billion on CKD costs and approximately 49.2 billion for end-stage renal disease, or ESRD, costs. ESRD is total and permanent kidney failure that is treated with kidney dialysis or with a kidney transplant. There are approximately 775,000 people in the United States living on kidney dialysis or with a kidney transplant and approximately 130,000 new ESRD cases occur annually. Each year kidney disease kills more people than breast cancer or prostate cancer. According to the 2019 United States Renal Data System report, there were approximately 105,000 deaths from ESRD in 2018. There is a significant medical need to slow progression of kidney disease and reduce the number of patients progressing to kidney failure. To help improve the diagnosis and management of kidney disease, the National Kidney Foundation, or NKF, has divided CKD into five stages. The severity of CKD at each stage is identified by the estimated glomerular filtration rate, or eGFR. Treatment during the first four stages of CKD focuses on ways to preserve kidney function for as long as possible. ESRD is the final stage of CKD in which the patient typically requires renal replacement therapy, i.e., dialysis or a kidney transplant, for survival. Stages of CKD Overview of Metabolic Acidosis Diabetes and hypertension have long been recognized as modifiable risk factors for the progression of CKD. More recently, metabolic acidosis, a serious condition in which the body has accumulated too much acid, has also been identified as a key modifiable risk factor for the progression of CKD. The human body generates acid every day through normal food intake and metabolism. Sources of acid include amino acids and nucleic acids from daily dietary intake and digestion of proteins. A healthy kidney counteracts these sources of acid through excretion mechanisms that rid the body of the excess acid and by restoring bicarbonate, a base that buffers acid. Metabolic acidosis results when the kidneys can no longer excrete sufficient acid or reabsorb sufficient bicarbonate back into the blood stream to balance acid production. If left untreated, metabolic acidosis can result in accelerated kidney disease progression and has also been shown to negatively impact bone and muscle health. Metabolic acidosis can be diagnosed by measuring the level of bicarbonate in the serum, which is routinely analyzed as part of a standard metabolic panel. Properly functioning kidneys will maintain a serum bicarbonate level of 8 between 22 to 29 milliequivalents per liter, or mEq/L. A persistent serum bicarbonate level below 22 mEq/L indicates metabolic acidosis. The prevalence and severity of metabolic acidosis in people with CKD progressively rises as kidney function declines. We estimate the prevalence of metabolic acidosis to be 9.4 of the estimated 15 million patients with Stage 3a CKD, 18.1 of the estimated 6 million patients with Stage 3b CKD and 31.5 of the estimated 2 million patients with Stage 4 and Stage 5 CKD (non-dialysis patients), resulting in a total estimated prevalence of approximately 3 million patients with metabolic acidosis and CKD in the United States. Metabolic Acidosis Poses a Significant Health Risk to Approximately 3 Million Patients with CKD in the United States Metabolic acidosis can accelerate kidney disease progression and lead to bone demineralization, muscle wasting and an increased risk of mortality. In patients with CKD, adaptations by the kidneys in response to an accumulating acid load result in increased acid excretion per nephron by the remaining nephrons, but over time these adaptations have deleterious effects on kidney tissue, resulting in further kidney damage. The specific mechanisms that link metabolic acidosis to accelerated progression of kidney disease involve a cascade of events whereby acid accumulation leads to increased production of select peptides and hormones, including endothelin-1, aldosterone and angiotensin II, that increase the secretion of acid through the proximal and distal renal tubules of the remaining healthy nephrons in the compromised kidney. This provides a short-term beneficial impact on acid excretion, however, sustained over-production of these hormones results in long-term consequences, including inflammation, renal fibrosis, tubular atrophy and proteinuria. Over time, a vicious cycle of worsening metabolic acidosis and accelerated progression of kidney disease can result. An increased risk of fractures and renal osteodystrophy as well as muscle wasting and reduced physical functioning have also been associated with worsening metabolic acidosis. In patients with CKD whose kidney function is not sufficient to excrete their daily acid load, bone and muscle provide buffers for circulating acid, resulting in loss of bone density and increased muscle protein catabolism. Two large retrospective cohort analyses found that low serum 9 bicarbonate level was independently associated with adverse health outcomes related to physical functioning, such as gait speed, quadriceps strength, failure to thrive and fractures/falls (Abramowitz et al., 2011; Reaven et al., 2019). Several prospective studies of patients with metabolic acidosis and CKD have reported that treatment of metabolic acidosis can increase muscle mass (de Brito-Ashurst et al., 2009; Dubey et al., 2018), improve muscle function (Abramowitz et al., 2013) and physical function related quality of life (de Brito-Ashurst et al., 2015). The importance of treating metabolic acidosis has been noted in both National and International kidney disease treatment guidelines. The NKF s Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative, or KDOQI, guidelines and the International Society of Nephology s Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes, or KDIGO, guidelines suggest that in patients with CKD, serum bicarbonate be maintained above 22 mEq/L. Serum bicarbonate concentrations 2012) showed that less than 3 , or 28 of 1,039 patients with CKD and serum bicarbonate levels 22mEq/L were receiving an oral alkali supplement. A retrospective cohort study of adults in Manitoba, Canada, (Tangri et al., 2020), concluded that less than 6 of 5,368 patients with CKD and serum bicarbonate values between 12-22 mEq/L were receiving an oral alkali supplement. Because the Canadian health care system includes oral alkali supplements in their formulary, the analysis included an evaluation of the adherence to oral alkali supplements. The data show that, more than two thirds of patients (68 had discontinued oral alkali therapy at one year. The use of oral alkali supplements in patients with metabolic acidosis and CKD who were enrolled in the TRCA-301/TRCA-301E clinical trial was less than 10 of subjects enrolled in the study (Wesson et al., 2019). Oral Alkali Use is Low in Patients with Metabolic Acidosis and CKD Dobre, 2012, Tangri 2020, Wesson, 2019, Tangri 2019. Our primary research indicates that most nephrologists understand the importance of treating metabolic acidosis to slow kidney disease progression, yet the analyses of actual treatment rates indicate a serious gap between the understanding and actual diagnosis and treatment. We believe that this gap is due to the lack of an FDA-approved chronic treatment for metabolic acidosis that can be used in the broad population of patients with metabolic acidosis and CKD, including those with sodium-sensitive comorbidities. The low use of oral alkali supplements may be explained by the lack of supportive data from blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials that confirm the efficacy and safety of these unapproved supplements. While clinical research studies conducted in carefully selected patient populations have shown that oral alkali supplementation can result in slowing of CKD progression in patients with metabolic acidosis, two recent multicenter, placebo-controlled studies that used doses of sodium bicarbonate typically used in clinical practice, i.e., 0.5 to 1.0 grams, three times daily, both achieved very little difference in mean serum bicarbonate level between the active and placebo groups 11 (approximately 1 mEq/L difference after 2 years) and showed no clinical benefits of sodium bicarbonate treatment (the BiCARB Study, Witham et al., ERA-EDTA Poster Presentation 2019; Melamed et al., 2019). The doses of sodium bicarbonate used in these trials may not have been large enough to achieve sufficient separation in serum bicarbonate in active- versus placebo-treated subjects. These doses may have been chosen because of concern for the deleterious effect of sodium that is delivered with orally administered alkali supplements, particularly in the CKD patient population. Each gram of sodium bicarbonate delivers 274 mg of sodium. Approximately 90 of patients with later-stage CKD suffer from sodium-sensitive comorbid conditions, such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, heart failure or edema, and require a sodium-restricted diet. KDIGO guidelines recommend that patients with CKD consume less than 2 grams of total sodium per day, but according to the CDC, the average diet in the United States includes approximately 3.4 grams of sodium each day. It has been demonstrated that achieving a 2 to 3 mEq/L increase in serum bicarbonate requires 4 to 6 grams of sodium bicarbonate (for an 80 kilogram, or kg, patient) which results in an additional 1.1 to 1.6 grams of sodium added to the patient s daily intake, which is already in excess of guideline recommendations (Abramowitz et al., 2013). The effects of oral alkali supplementation on overall health and wellbeing also require further evaluation. One of the first multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of oral sodium bicarbonate versus placebo (Witham et al., ERA-EDTA Poster Presentation 2019) was commissioned by the UK National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment Programme to evaluate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of oral sodium bicarbonate in the management of older people with CKD and mild metabolic acidosis. The trial enrolled 300 non-dialysis patients with Stage 4 or 5 CKD with serum bicarbonate concentrations Veverimer is a novel, non-absorbed, orally-administered polymer that is designed to bind hydrochloric acid in the GI tract and remove it from the body through excretion in the feces, thereby decreasing the total amount of acid in the body and increasing serum bicarbonate. Veverimer is administered orally as a suspension in water. Veverimer removes acid from the GI tract without delivering additional sodium or other counterions, such as potassium or calcium, which, if approved, would allow for the chronic treatment of patients with common sodium-sensitive comorbidities such as hypertension, edema and heart failure. Veverimer Target Product Profile We have designed veverimer to target the following product profile: Effectively Treat Metabolic Acidosis: Bind and remove sufficient amounts of acid such that a majority of the patients will achieve a clinically meaningful increase in serum bicarbonate. Subject to the results of our renal outcomes trial, VALOR-CKD, veverimer may also slow the progression of CKD through the treatment of metabolic acidosis. Well-Tolerated: Based on our long-term TRCA-301E trial results, patients reported GI-related adverse events at a similar rate to placebo. These events were generally mild, self-limited and did not require dose adjustment of veverimer. Suitable for a Broad Population of Patients, including Patients with Sodium-Sensitive Comorbidities: Treat metabolic acidosis without delivering sodium or other counterions. Compatible with Other Medications: Allow concomitant dosing of common CKD medications. Veverimer s unique characteristics include a particle size designed to prevent systemic absorption and size-exclusion that provides high selectivity for hydrochloric acid. Convenient, Once-Daily, Oral Administration: In our TRCA-301/TRCA-301E trial, subjects self-administered 3-, 6- or 9-gram doses, once daily, with high overall compliance. Room-Temperature Stable: Current data demonstrate 12-month room temperature stability and we plan to have data supporting 24-month shelf-life at room temperature at the time of the commercial launch. Veverimer Mechanism of Action The human body generates acid every day through normal food intake and metabolism. Sources of acid include amino acids and nucleic acids from daily dietary intake and digestion of proteins. The daily load of nonvolatile acids from metabolic processes amounts to approximately 1 mEq per kg of body weight, or 50 to 100 mEq per day for adults. Prior studies with alkali supplementation have shown that neutralization of 40 to 80 (20 to 80 mEq) of the daily acid produced can increase serum bicarbonate levels (de Brito-Ashurst et al., 2009; Phisitkul et al., 2010). Acid binding in the GI tract is a novel approach to treating metabolic acidosis and increasing serum bicarbonate levels without introducing deleterious counterions or metals. This approach mimics the physiologic response to acid removal seen with persistent vomiting or nasogastric suction that results in an elevated serum bicarbonate level. To achieve the desired effect of increasing serum bicarbonate with a convenient daily dose of less than 10 grams per day, an acid binding polymer should have an amine capacity to bind at least 5 mEq of proton/gram. Once protonated, the acid binding polymer needs to preserve the effect of the proton binding by not removing anions such as fatty and bile acids that represent precursors metabolized to bicarbonate in the blood. The complementary anion to be bound that ensures net acid removal from the GI tract is chloride, the smallest anion present in the GI tract. Veverimer is a low-swelling, spherical polymer bead that is approximately 100 micrometers in diameter. It is a single, high molecular weight, crosslinked polyamine molecule. The size of veverimer prevents systemic absorption from the GI tract. The high degree of cross-linking within veverimer limits swelling and the overall volume in the GI tract, with the goal of facilitating good GI tolerability. The high amine content of veverimer provides proton binding capacity of approximately 10 mEq/gram of polymer. Size exclusion built into the three-dimensional structure of the polymer enables preferential binding of chloride versus larger inorganic and organic anions, including phosphate, citrate, fatty acids and bile acids. This size exclusion mechanism allows a majority of the binding capacity to be used for hydrochloric acid binding. 13 The mechanism of action of veverimer is illustrated below: Veverimer Mechanism of Action Our Development Program for Veverimer Overview The key clinical trials in our development program for veverimer include our ongoing VALOR-CKD trial, a completed 135-subject, Phase 1/2 trial, TRCA-101, a completed 217-subject, Phase 3 clinical trial, TRCA-301 and a completed 196-subject, Phase 3 extension trial, TRCA-301E. Our VALOR-CKD trial is evaluating the efficacy and safety of veverimer in delaying CKD progression and whether treatment with veverimer improves physical functioning in subjects with metabolic acidosis. The primary endpoint in VALOR-CKD is a composite of renal death, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) or a confirmed 40 reduction in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (DD40). We anticipate randomizing approximately 1,600 subjects in VALOR-CKD and the trial is currently designed to terminate when 511 subjects with primary endpoint events have been positively adjudicated. The VALOR-CKD trial also includes two interim analyses for early stopping for efficacy: after 150 primary endpoint events and 250 primary endpoint events have accrued. The VALOR-CKD trial also includes, as its first two secondary efficacy endpoints, evaluation of the effect of veverimer versus placebo after one year of treatment on patient-reported and objective measures of physical functioning, using the KDQOL Physical Functioning Survey and the Repeated Chair Stand test, respectively. Although not part of any efficacy endpoints, the VALOR-CKD trial will also provide information regarding the change from baseline in serum bicarbonate in veverimer and placebo-treated subjects. Both TRCA-101 and TRCA-301 utilized change from baseline in serum bicarbonate as their primary endpoint. Eligible subjects who completed the 12-week treatment period in the TRCA-301 trial were invited to continue in our extension trial, TRCA-301E. The primary endpoint of the TRCA-301E trial was the assessment of the long-term safety profile of veverimer versus placebo. Veverimer Clinical and Nonclinical Programs VALOR-CKD Renal Outcomes Trial The protocol for the VALOR-CKD trial was designed in collaboration with a Steering Committee of international key opinion leaders in the fields of chronic kidney disease progression and metabolic acidosis and with input from the FDA. It is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of subjects with Stage 3b or 4 CKD (eGFR of 20 to 40 mL/min/1.73m 2 and metabolic acidosis (serum bicarbonate levels of 12 to 20 mEq/L). The eligibility criteria for the 14 VALOR-CKD trial are similar to those used in our TRCA-301 trial. Based on observations from the TRCA-301 trial, we strengthened the screening requirements in the VALOR-CKD trial to enable enrollment of subjects with confirmed metabolic acidosis at baseline. In the VALOR-CKD trial, subjects are treated with veverimer (3, 6 or 9 g QD) or placebo, with titration to attempt to maintain serum bicarbonate in the normal range (22 to 29 mEq/L). VALOR-CKD Renal Outcomes Trial The primary endpoint of the VALOR-CKD trial compares the time to first renal event, with a renal event defined as a confirmed 40 reduction in eGFR, progressing to ESRD, or renal death, in veverimer-treated subjects versus subjects in the placebo group. We anticipate randomizing approximately 1,600 subjects and the trial is designed to end when the independent blinded Clinical Endpoint Adjudication Committee has positively adjudicated 511 subjects with primary endpoint events, which , based on the current rate of event accrual, we estimate will occur in the first half of 2024. The VALOR-CKD trial also includes two interim analyses for early stopping for efficacy: after 150 subjects have accrued primary endpoint events (anticipated in the second half of 2021, based on the current rate of event accrual) and after 250 subjects have accrued primary endpoint events (anticipated in mid-2022, based on the current rate of event accrual). These interim analyses will be conducted by an independent unblinded Interim Analysis Committee. If the independent unblinded Interim Analysis Committee does not recommend stopping the trial early for efficacy, we will receive no information from these interim analyses. The interim analyses employ the O Brien-Fleming alpha spending function, which preserves the majority of alpha for the final analysis when the trial reaches 511 subjects with primary endpoint events. The VALOR-CKD trial also includes, as its first two secondary efficacy endpoints, evaluation of the effect of veverimer versus placebo after one year of treatment on patient-reported and objective measures of physical functioning, using the KDQOL Physical Functioning Survey and the Repeated Chair Stand test, respectively. Although not part of any efficacy endpoints, the VALOR-CKD trial will also provide information regarding the change from baseline in serum bicarbonate in veverimer and placebo-treated subjects. In order to appropriately power the VALOR-CKD trial, we worked with Dr. Navdeep Tangri to determine the anticipated magnitude of impact from each 1 mEq/L increase in serum bicarbonate on kidney disease progression. Dr. Tangri is an Associate Professor of Medicine in the Department of Medicine and Community Health Sciences and the Scientific Director of the Chronic Disease Innovation Center at University of Manitoba. He is a recognized expert in CKD risk prediction and has developed a validated model which is an accepted standard for predicting the risk of kidney disease progression which was published in The Journal of the American Medical Association, or JAMA (Tangri et al., 2011). Initially, Dr. Tangri developed for us a predictive metabolic acidosis model, or the Predictive MA Model, that specifically looked at the quantitative relationship between serum bicarbonate level and the risk of kidney disease progression. The relationship between serum bicarbonate and the risk of a 40 decline in eGFR or ESRD was approximately linear, independent of baseline kidney function (eGFR), and consistent across subgroups of patients with reduced eGFR and those with established metabolic acidosis. Furthermore, it showed that each 1 mEq/L increase in serum bicarbonate was associated with a 6 to 9 reduction in the risk of CKD progression. These data were reviewed with the FDA and formed the basis for our original powering assumptions for the VALOR-CKD trial as submitted in the initial NDA. After submission of the NDA, we developed with Dr. Tangri a time-dependent predictive model, or the Time-Dependent Predictive Model, that used all available measurements of serum bicarbonate collected longitudinally in a cohort of 24,384 U.S. participants with CKD Stages 3-5 and metabolic acidosis from the Optum EHR+ Integrated database, who had an average of 19 measurements of serum bicarbonate over a median follow up time of 3.7 years (interquartile range: 1.6-5.9 years). This model assessed the quantitative relationship between within-patient change in serum bicarbonate and the risk of a 40 decline in eGFR or ESRD. The results from this new Time-Dependent Predictive Model are consistent with those of our previous model and show an 8.4 lower risk of CKD progression for each 1 mEq/L higher serum bicarbonate. In addition, as we continued to analyze data from our completed TRCA-301/TRCA-301E trial, we learned that the magnitude of the veverimer treatment effect in those studies is best described by the between-group difference in the 15 medians, rather than the difference in the LS means as originally specified, because the data are not normally distributed. The Week 52 median placebo-subtracted treatment effect in the TRCA-301E trial was an increase in serum bicarbonate of 3.15 mEq/L. Using the 8.4 reduction in the risk of CKD progression per 1 mEq/L increase in serum bicarbonate from the Time-Dependent Predictive Model and a median treatment effect of 3.15 mEq/L, we assume a hazard ratio of 0.76 for the VALOR-CKD trial. Based on this assumed hazard ratio, with a sample size of 1,600 subjects, the trial has 87 power to show a 24 difference in primary endpoint events. Based on this analysis, which was completed after receipt of the CRL from the FDA, we believe that the VALOR-CKD trial is adequately designed and powered to confirm the clinical benefit of veverimer treatment in slowing CKD progression. The VALOR-CKD trial also includes, as its first two secondary efficacy endpoints, evaluation of the effect of veverimer versus placebo after one year of treatment on patient-reported and objective measures of physical functioning, using the KDQOL Physical Functioning Survey and the Repeated Chair Stand test, respectively. Although not part of any efficacy endpoints, the VALOR-CKD trial can also provide information regarding the change from baseline in serum bicarbonate in veverimer and placebo-treated subjects. As of February 22, 2021, the VALOR-CKD trial has randomized 1,433 of 1,600 subjects with an average treatment duration of approximately one year and has accrued 69 of the 511 required subjects with positively adjudicated primary endpoint events. Based on feedback from the FDA at the End-of-Review Type A meeting, recruitment has been closed in all regions except for the United States, Canada and Western Europe. At the end of recruitment, we anticipate approximately 67 of subjects to be enrolled at Eastern European sites, 19 at U.S., Western European and Canadian sites, 7 at Latin American sites, and 7 at sites in the Asia-Pacific region. Our goal is to complete enrollment by the end of 2021; to meet this goal we may need to reopen recruitment at sites outside of the United States, but we will not reopen recruitment at sites in Eastern Europe. We intend to ensure that no single site in the VALOR-CKD trial provides 5 of the total number of trial subjects. The FDA s acceptance of the VALOR-CKD data in support of an NDA resubmission, including its assessment of the magnitude and durability of the veverimer treatment effect across the various geographical regions where the study is conducted and the acceptability of the data from non-US countries or regions which will comprise a substantial proportion of the data from the trial, will ultimately be a review issue. TRCA-301 Phase 3 Clinical Trial and TRCA-301E Extension Clinical Trial TRCA-301 Phase 3 Clinical Trial In May 2018, we completed our Phase 3 clinical trial, TRCA-301. We conducted the trial at 47 sites in the United States and Europe, of which 37 sites enrolled patients. In the TRCA-301 trial, 190 trial subjects were located in Eastern Europe, and 27 trial subjects were located in the U.S. In March 2019, the results of this trial were published in The Lancet. The double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial enrolled 217 subjects with Stage 3b or 4 CKD (an estimated glomerular filtration rate, or eGFR, of 20 to 40 mL/min/1.73m 2 and low serum bicarbonate levels (between 12 and 20 mEq/L). At the beginning of the 12-week treatment period, subjects were randomized in a 4:3 ratio to receive once-daily, or QD, veverimer or placebo. Subjects in the active group initially received a QD dose of 6 grams of veverimer (2 packets). After week 4, bi-directional blinded dose adjustments to 3 grams/day (1 packet) or 9 grams/day (3 packets) were allowed in order to attempt to maintain serum bicarbonate in the normal range. Subjects in the placebo group initially received 2 packets of placebo, with the same ability for bi-directional dose adjustments after 4 weeks. The dose titration algorithm required down-titration at serum bicarbonate values of 27 to 30 mEq/L. Subjects with a serum bicarbonate level >30 mEq/L underwent an interruption of the study drug in accordance with the titration algorithm. Subjects were permitted to continue their existing oral alkali supplement during the trial, provided dosing remained stable. Because the appearance and weight of veverimer and placebo were not identical, study drug dispensing, preparation, supervision of the subject s first dose in the clinic, and study drug accountability were done by an unblinded designated site staff member who had no other responsibilities for the trial. The trial sponsor, statistician, investigators, patients, and all CRO staff (except personnel responsible for monitoring drug dispensing and accountability records) remained blinded to treatment assignments throughout the trial. Site personnel were trained on blinding requirements, and these requirements were detailed in a blinding plan. 16 TRCA-301 Phase 3 Clinical Trial The underlying comorbid conditions of veverimer-treated subjects and subjects in the placebo group in the TRCA-301 trial were well-balanced and included 97 hypertension, 65 type 2 diabetes, 44 left ventricular hypertrophy, and 31 congestive heart failure. During the three months prior to baseline, 12 of subjects had shortness of breath with exertion and 9 had edema or fluid overload. Nine percent of the total patient population in the trial reported the use of oral alkali therapy at baseline. TRCA-301 Phase 3 Trial Results Primary and Secondary Endpoints The serum bicarbonate levels of subjects were measured on day 1, week 1, week 2, and bi-weekly thereafter, up to and including week 14, which was a final post-treatment visit for those subjects not continuing into the TRCA-301E extension trial. The primary endpoint of the trial was an increase in serum bicarbonate level of at least 4 mEq/L or achieving a serum bicarbonate level in the normal range of 22 to 29 mEq/L, at the end of the 12-week treatment period. The secondary endpoint of the trial was the change from baseline in serum bicarbonate at the end of the 12-week treatment period. Analysis of our TRCA-301 Phase 3 trial demonstrated that treatment with veverimer resulted in statistically significant increases in serum bicarbonate, meeting both the primary and secondary endpoints. After 12 weeks of treatment, 59.2 of subjects in the veverimer-treated group, compared with 22.5 of subjects in the placebo group, had an increase in serum bicarbonate level of at least 4 mEq/L or achieved a serum bicarbonate level in the normal range of 22 to 29 mEq/L, which was the primary endpoint of the trial. The secondary endpoint of the trial, the least squares, or LS, mean change from baseline to week 12 in serum bicarbonate, was 4.42 mEq/L in the veverimer-treated group, compared with 1.78 mEq/L in the placebo group. The mean change in serum bicarbonate from baseline to week 12 was 4.5 mEq/L in the veverimer-treated group, compared with 1.7 mEq/L in the placebo group. The results of the primary and secondary endpoints were both highly statistically significant (p Summary Data for Our Phase 3 Clinical Trial, TRCA-301 Safety The overall safety profile of veverimer observed in our Phase 3 trial, TRCA-301, is consistent with that expected for the general population of patients with Stage 3 to 5 non-dialysis CKD and with similar non-absorbed polymer drugs with a site of action in the gastrointestinal tract. The incidence of serious adverse events was low and balanced in the two treatment groups. The types of serious adverse events were consistent with those expected in the study population, and none of the serious adverse events were assessed to be related to treatment by the trial investigator, Medical Monitor or Drug Safety and Pharmacovigilance Team. There were two deaths in the trial, and both of these occurred in the placebo group. Veverimer was well tolerated in our Phase 3 trial, TRCA-301. In total, over 95 of subjects in each of the groups completed the trial. Overall treatment-related adverse events occurred in 9.7 of subjects in the placebo group and 13.7 of veverimer-treated subjects. The most common treatment-related adverse events were mild to moderate GI disorders, which occurred in 5.4 of subjects in the placebo group and 12.9 of veverimer-treated subjects. The treatment-related GI adverse events that occurred in more than one subject in the trial included diarrhea, flatulence, nausea and constipation. The only other treatment-related adverse event that occurred in more than one subject was paresthesia (1.1 of subjects in the placebo group and 0.8 of veverimer-treated subjects). There were no apparent effects of veverimer on serum parameters, such as sodium, calcium, potassium, phosphate, magnesium, or low-density lipoprotein observed in the trial that would indicate off-target effects of veverimer. A high serum bicarbonate level, defined as greater than 30 mEq/L, was observed transiently in 2 subjects, or 0.9 . Discontinuation of veverimer per the protocol-defined dosing algorithm resulted in normalization of serum bicarbonate in these subjects. TRCA-301E Extension Trial The TRCA-301E trial was a blinded, 40-week extension of the 12-week TRCA-301 trial, which randomized 217 subjects with non-dialysis dependent CKD and metabolic acidosis to treatment with veverimer (N=124) or placebo (N=93). Two hundred eight (208; 95.9 subjects completed the 12-week treatment period in the TRCA-301 trial and had the option to continue into the extension trial and receive the same blinded treatment (veverimer or placebo) to which they were assigned in the parent study. Of these, one hundred ninety-six subjects (196; 94.2 ), (114 in the veverimer group and 82 in the placebo group) elected and were qualified to continue in the extension trial. One hundred 18 eleven (111; 97.4 subjects in the veverimer group and 74 (90.2 subjects in placebo group completed the one-year treatment period. In the TRCA-301E trial, 179 of the enrolled trial subjects were located in Eastern Europe and 17 of the enrolled trial subjects were located in the U.S. TRCA-301E Phase 3 Extension Clinical Trial TRCA-301E Clinical Trial Results The TRCA-301E trial met its primary and all secondary endpoints. The primary endpoint of the TRCA-301E trial was an assessment of the long-term safety profile of veverimer versus placebo. In the veverimer group (versus placebo), we observed similar rates of treatment-emergent adverse events (81.3 versus 80.2 ), fewer serious adverse events (1.8 versus 4.9 ), and fewer adverse events leading to discontinuation (0 versus 1.2 ). In addition, in the veverimer group (versus placebo) there were fewer subjects who discontinued study treatment (2.6 versus 9.8 and a comparable rate of GI adverse events (21.4 versus 25.9 ). No serious adverse events were assessed to be related to study drug by the trial investigator, Medical Monitor or Drug Safety and Pharmacovigilance Team. Although not part of the primary endpoint, the statistical analysis plan for the TRCA-301E trial also specified a safety analysis comparing the veverimer and placebo groups for the time to the composite endpoint of death (all-cause mortality), dialysis/kidney transplant (renal replacement therapy) or a 50 decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate, or eGFR, (taken together, DD50) over the combined (TRCA-301/TRCA-301E trial) 52-week treatment period. Of the 124 subjects randomized to the veverimer group, 5 (4.0 subjects had a DD50 event. There were no deaths in the veverimer group and one veverimer-treated subject initiated dialysis during the 52-week treatment period. Of the 93 subjects randomized to the placebo group, 10 (10.8 subjects had a DD50 event, including four subjects who died and one who initiated dialysis during the 52-week treatment period. We observed an annualized DD50 incidence rate, calculated as 100 times the number of events divided by the total person-years, of 4.2 in the veverimer group versus 12.0 in the placebo group (p = 0.0224), representing a 65 reduction in the annualized event rate in veverimer-treated subjects versus subjects in the placebo group. The TRCA-301/TRCA-301E clinical trials were not designed or powered to assess this endpoint and no statistical alpha was allocated to the comparison; the studies enrolled only 217 subjects and followed them over a one-year treatment period to support the long-term safety and efficacy profile of veverimer. 19 TRCA-301 / TRCA-301E Trial Results (52 Weeks) Prespecified Time-to-Event Analyses The secondary endpoints of the TRCA-301E trial assessed the durability of effect of veverimer, both on serum bicarbonate levels and on measures of physical function, over the 52-week treatment period for those subjects who participated in the TRCA-301E trial. All were met with high statistical significance. The durability of effect of veverimer was assessed in subjects who enrolled in the 40-week extension trial, TRCA-301E. In veverimer-treated subjects, the proportion of subjects achieving an increase of at least 4 mEq/L or normalization of serum bicarbonate was similar at Week 12 and Week 52 (61 and 63 , respectively). Similarly, the magnitude of the change in serum bicarbonate from baseline to Week 12 and to Week 52 were similar in veverimer-treated subjects (4.6 mEq/L and 4.7 mEq/L, respectively). However, rather than remaining stable, the corresponding values for the placebo group increased from Week 12 to Week 52 (22 and 38 ; 1.7 mEq/L and 2.7 mEq/L, respectively). The reason that the treatment effect remained stable in veverimer-treated subjects but increased in placebo-treated subjects from Week 12 to Week 52 is not known; however, the discontinuation rate was ~3-fold higher in the placebo group and this may have contributed. It is also possible that being in the trial may have resulted in more attention paid to diet and lifestyle factors in the placebo group. Notwithstanding the results observed in the placebo group, we saw no waning of the effect of veverimer on serum bicarbonate over the 1-year treatment period in TRCA-301E. Measures of physical function were assessed through the self-reported responses to the KDQOL Physical Functioning Survey and the Repeated Chair Stand Test. Improvement from baseline to end of treatment in the self-reported responses to the KDQOL Physical Functioning Survey was significantly greater in the veverimer group (11.4 points) compared to the placebo group (-0.7 points), with a between-group difference of 12.1 points in favor of veverimer (p clinically important difference for improvement in this measure of objective physical function. We believe the results from the KDQOL Physical Functioning Survey and the Repeated Chair Stand Test are consistent with each other and both indicate a clinically meaningful improvement in physical function and related aspects of quality of life for veverimer-treated subjects. TRCA-301 / TRCA-301E Trial Results (52 Weeks) Clinically Meaningful Improvement in Physical Function KDQOL Physical Function Domain Repeated Chair Stand Test Academic literature describes CKD as a clinical model of premature aging, indicating that patients with CKD often experience many of the complications of aging, but at younger ages than the general population. This includes elevated 21 rates of aging-related disorders, including markedly reduced physical function compared to adult populations of the same age. This is a major problem because impaired physical function leads to significant morbidity, including high rates of falls and fractures, and is also a risk factor for death. Therefore, preserving physical function is critical in patients with CKD. Dr. Matthew Abramowitz, Associate Professor of Medicine at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, has conducted a post-hoc analysis of age-related physical function improvements that were observed with veverimer in our TRCA-301E long-term extension trial. First, the analysis showed that at baseline, 45 of our trial population was slower in performing the Repeated Chair Stand Test than the average 80 to 89-year old, despite an average age of 62 years. Second, the mean improvement of 4.3 seconds in Repeated Chair Stand Test time observed in veverimer-treated subjects in the TRCA-301E trial was greater than the difference in mean expected test-time performance between individuals in their 80s and those in their 60s, suggesting that the 4.3 second improvement in test time observed in veverimer-treated subjects is equivalent to an approximately 20-year reduction in aging-related physical functioning. Dr. Abramowitz concluded that interventions that improve physical function in patients with CKD have the potential to restore a substantial proportion of age-predicted loss of performance. TRCA-101 Phase 1/2 Clinical Trial In 2016, we completed our Phase 1/2 trial, TRCA-101, a 135-subject, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of veverimer. In this trial, subjects received either placebo or one of four different dosing regimens of veverimer for two weeks as shown in the diagram below: Veverimer Phase 1/2 Clinical Trial The subjects were patients with Stage 3 or 4 CKD with serum bicarbonate levels at baseline between 12 and 20 mEq/L. The treatment groups were demographically well matched, and the mean serum bicarbonate levels at baseline ranged between 17.5 and 18.0 mEq/L across the treatment groups. Comorbid conditions of the subjects enrolled in TRCA-101 included 93 of patients with hypertension, 70 with type 2 diabetes, 29 with left ventricular hypertrophy and 21 with congestive heart failure. We conducted the trial at five in-patient clinical research units where the subjects were monitored for the duration of the 2-week treatment period. During the 16-day in-unit residence (including the 14-day treatment period), clinical trial subjects were given a diet controlled for protein, caloric content, anions, cations and fiber, in accordance with dietary recommendations for patients with CKD. The potential renal acid load, or PRAL, value was calculated for the daily meal plans to ensure that the trial diet was neither acidic nor basic. Daily PRAL values averaged 0.8 mEq/day. Average protein intake during the trial was 0.7 g/kg/day. The primary objective of this trial was to assess the safety and tolerability of veverimer across a selection of doses in subjects with CKD and metabolic acidosis. The secondary objective was to evaluate efficacy. The serum bicarbonate levels of subjects were measured on a daily basis. Statistically significant increases in serum bicarbonate levels were observed in all veverimer-treated groups within 24 to 72 hours of initiation of therapy. After 14 days of treatment, the mean increase in serum bicarbonate levels from baseline in each of the veverimer-treated groups was between 2.95 and 3.83 mEq/L, with a mean serum bicarbonate increase of 3.3 mEq/L in the combined veverimer group. All these results were statistically significant (p-value Veverimer Significantly Increased Mean Serum Bicarbonate Throughout the 2-week Treatment Period, with Serum Bicarbonate Rapidly Returning Toward Baseline After Treatment Discontinuation In our Phase 1/2 trial, veverimer was well-tolerated. All subjects completed treatment and remained in the trial through the applicable follow-up period. All treatment emergent adverse events, or TEAEs, were mild or moderate, and there were no serious adverse events. The most common TEAE was diarrhea which was reported by 20.2 of veverimer-treated subjects as compared to 12.9 of subjects in the placebo group. All cases of diarrhea were mild, self-limited, and none required treatment. There were no apparent effects of veverimer on parameters, such as sodium, calcium, potassium, phosphate, magnesium, or low-density lipoprotein observed in the trial that would indicate off-target effects of veverimer. There were no apparent effects on vital signs, such as blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate or temperature, or body weight. The results of this trial were published in the Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (Bushinsky, et al., 2018). Nonclinical Studies We have conducted a range of nonclinical in vivo and in vitro studies to assess the mechanism of action, pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and toxicology of veverimer. Nonclinical in vitro and in vivo pharmacology studies demonstrated robust proton and chloride binding and retention by the veverimer polymer resulting in removal of hydrochloric acid from the body. In vitro studies demonstrated that veverimer can selectively bind and retain chloride under conditions that mimic the pH, transit times, and ionic content of various compartments of the GI tract. The marked binding capacity and selectivity for chloride observed with veverimer in vitro translates into in vivo pharmacological effects. Removal of acid by veverimer results in a dose-dependent increase in mean serum bicarbonate, as observed in rats with adenine-induced nephropathy and low serum bicarbonate. A significant increase in fecal chloride relative to controls suggests that veverimer retained its functional integrity during transit through the rat GI tract. This study in an animal model of CKD illustrated the potential of veverimer to correct depleted serum bicarbonate levels, the hallmark of metabolic acidosis. 23 Safety pharmacology assessments of the central nervous, respiratory, cardiovascular, and GI systems did not identify any veverimer-related adverse effects at oral doses up to 4 g/kg (central nervous system, respiratory) and up to 2 g/kg (GI) in rats and at 2 g/kg (cardiovascular) in dogs. Lack of veverimer absorption from the GI tract was demonstrated in both rats and dogs administered a single oral dose of radiolabeled [ 14 C]-veverimer. Because radioactivity was not observed in the plasma of either species, metabolism was not evaluated. The lack of absorption, in conjunction with the in vivo pharmacology study in rats, supports that veverimer is not metabolized or degraded but maintains functional, and therefore, structural integrity during transit through the GI tract following oral administration. The results of the radiolabeled veverimer absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion, or ADME, studies demonstrating a lack of oral bioavailability is consistent with the physicochemical properties of veverimer (insolubility in aqueous and organic solvents, particle size averaging 100 micrometers in diameter, and particle stability). Repeat-dose, GLP toxicology studies of up to 26 weeks duration in rats and 39 weeks duration in dogs demonstrated that veverimer has a very low order of toxicity and was well tolerated. There were no effects on male or female reproductive organs and local GI tolerance was good. The no observed adverse effect level, or NOAEL, in both the rat and dog in the chronic toxicity studies was the highest dose of 2 g/kg/day; this dose of veverimer is 13-fold higher than the highest proposed human dose of 9 g/day (0.15 g/kg/day based on a 60-kg patient). We also established that the polymer has no effect on the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins, such as A, D2, D3, and E. Reproductive toxicity studies indicate there are no adverse veverimer-related effects on maternal reproductive function. Upon a resubmission of our NDA for veverimer, we are prepared to discuss the embryofetal development and teratogenicity data with the FDA with respect to pregnancy label language. We do not expect these discussions to lead to any change in the pregnancy risk statement in the anticipated label due to the non-absorbed nature of veverimer. Veverimer was not mutagenic or clastogenic when evaluated in genotoxicity studies. Given the non-absorbed nature of veverimer, we were granted a waiver from FDA for fertility and early embryonic development (Segment I) and peri/postnatal development (Segment III) reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity studies. Drug-drug Interaction Studies Veverimer is not systemically absorbed; therefore, its potential for DDIs is limited to those that occur in the GI tract (i.e., direct binding or indirect effects resulting from transient increases in gastric pH). We assessed the potential for DDIs with veverimer both in vitro and in vivo in healthy subjects. In vitro binding to veverimer was evaluated with 16 drugs of varying molecular weight and charge. Human DDI studies were conducted with the 2 drugs (furosemide, aspirin) that showed the most in vitro binding to veverimer. The effect of veverimer on gastric pH was measured continuously in vivo in healthy subjects using a microelectrode pH probe placed in the gastric compartment. Human DDI studies were conducted with 3 orally administered drugs with pH-dependent solubility (dabigatran, furosemide, warfarin). Veverimer did not bind to any of the positively charged, neutral or zwitterionic drugs tested in vitro. It bound to three small (Molecular Weight information regarding co-administration of veverimer with other oral medications will be subject to FDA review and approval. Veverimer Regulatory Pathway Our regulatory goal is to obtain FDA approval through the Accelerated Approval Program based upon veverimer's effect on serum bicarbonate or traditional approval based upon veverimer's effect on slowing CKD progression and/or on improving physical functioning in patients with metabolic acidosis associated with CKD. The FDA s Accelerated Approval Program allows for drugs for serious conditions that address an unmet medical need to be approved based on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. Surrogate endpoints are used instead of clinical outcomes in some clinical trials. Surrogate endpoints are used when the clinical outcomes might take a very long time to study, or in cases where the clinical benefit of improving the surrogate endpoint, such as controlling blood pressure, is well understood. Clinical trials are needed to show that surrogate endpoints can be relied upon to predict, or correlate with, clinical benefit. Surrogate endpoints that have undergone this testing are called validated surrogate endpoints and those are accepted by the FDA as evidence of benefit. Surrogate endpoints that the FDA determines are reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit but are not yet validated may be used to support approval, in some cases. This is accomplished through the FDA s Accelerated Approval Program, which is intended to provide patients with serious diseases more rapid access to promising therapies. Because such surrogate endpoints have not been validated, sponsors relying on them to support an accelerated approval are generally required to verify the predicted clinical benefit of their products with confirmatory postmarketing clinical trials. We believe that veverimer meets the requirements for the FDA s Accelerated Approval Program based upon meeting the following three criteria: Treatment of a Serious Condition: There is evidence that the progression of CKD to ESRD is a serious condition and the chronic treatment of metabolic acidosis may slow the progression of CKD. Meaningful Advantage over Available Therapy: There is an unmet need for chronic therapies that slow progression to ESRD in patients with CKD and metabolic acidosis. There are no FDA-approved chronic treatments for metabolic acidosis and there exists a large population of patients with metabolic acidosis and CKD. Demonstrates an Effect on an Endpoint That Is Reasonably Likely to Predict Clinical Benefit: There are a number of prospective and retrospective studies that show that serum bicarbonate is an appropriate surrogate endpoint and that increasing serum bicarbonate is reasonably likely to predict slowing of progression of CKD. As an alternative to approval through the Accelerated Approval Program, we may pursue approval of veverimer through the traditional approval pathway based upon veverimer s effect on the slowing of CKD progression or improving physical functioning. To satisfy the requirements for traditional approval we would be required to provide the FDA with sufficient data about clinical efficacy and safety in a sufficient number of subjects to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of veverimer and to provide adequate information for the labeling of veverimer. In most cases, the FDA requires at least two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the product candidate. A single Phase 3 clinical trial may be sufficient in certain circumstances, including (1) where the clinical trial is a large multicenter clinical trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome and confirmation of the result in a second clinical trial would be practically or ethically impossible or (2) when in conjunction with other confirmatory evidence. We submitted our New Drug Application, or NDA, for veverimer through the Accelerated Approval Program in August 2019, and in August 2020, we received a Complete Response Letter, or CRL, from the FDA related to our NDA for veverimer. According to the CRL, the FDA is seeking additional data beyond the TRCA-301/TRCA-301E trial regarding the magnitude and durability of the treatment effect of veverimer on the surrogate marker of serum bicarbonate and expressed concern regarding whether the demonstrated effect size would be reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. In addition, the CRL questioned the applicability of the treatment effect to the U.S. population and the practice of medicine in the United States. The FDA also expressed concern as to the reliability of the findings given that the findings for the TRCA-301/TRCA-301E trial were driven by a single, high-enrolling trial site located in Eastern Europe. The CRL did not raise any concerns related to FDA s completed inspection of the highest enrolling clinical trial 25 site in the TRCA-301/TRCA-301E trial and there was no FDA Form 483 issued. There were no safety, clinical pharmacology/biopharmaceutics, CMC, or non-clinical issues identified in the CRL. The CRL provided multiple options for resolving the identified deficiencies, including submission of the data from at least one additional adequate and well-controlled trial demonstrating the efficacy of veverimer for the treatment of metabolic acidosis associated with CKD. We held an End-of-Review Type A meeting, or Type A meeting, with the FDA's Division of Cardiology and Nephrology, or the Division, in October 2020. The Division agreed, in principle, that an interim analysis of serum bicarbonate data from the VALOR-CKD trial proposed by Tricida could address the Division's concerns regarding the reliability of the TRCA-301/TRCA-301E trial data and the relevance of those trial findings to the U.S. population provided certain conditions were met. Based on other feedback from the FDA during the Type A meeting, we believed the Division would also require evidence of veverimer's effect on CKD progression from a near-term interim analysis of the VALOR-CKD trial for accelerated approval and that the FDA would be unlikely to rely solely on serum bicarbonate data for determination of efficacy. Accordingly, we submitted a Formal Dispute Resolution Request, or FDRR, solely requesting that the Office of New Drugs, or OND, find that the magnitude of serum bicarbonate change seen in the TRCA-301/TRCA-301E trial is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit in the treatment of metabolic acidosis associated with CKD and that it can therefore serve as the basis for accelerated approval. In February 2021, the OND issued a decision on our FDRR. While the OND acknowledged that the TRCA-301 and TRCA-301E trials met their serum bicarbonate endpoints with statistical significance, the OND denied the appeal. In its Appeal Denied Letter, or ADL, the OND not only addressed the issue of magnitude of serum bicarbonate change, but cited all of the deficiencies in the CRL in concluding that the data provided in support of the veverimer NDA did not support approval through the Accelerated Approval Program. The OND concluded that the magnitude of the increases in serum bicarbonate levels shown in the TRCA-301/TRCA-301E trial were not of sufficient size or duration to establish that treatment with veverimer would be reasonably likely to provide a discernible reduction in CKD progression. In addition, the OND found that the intended confirmatory trial, VALOR-CKD (also known as TRCA-303), was underpowered to detect a 13 reduction in slowing of CKD progression. This finding was based on information included in the initial NDA submission, including the placebo-subtracted LS mean change from baseline in serum bicarbonate observed in the TRCA-301/TRCA-301E trial and the original Predictive MA Model. The OND also raised concerns regarding the robustness of the study results given that the veverimer NDA was supported by a single registrational trial (TRCA-301/TRCA-301E), which must, alone, provide persuasive evidence of benefit. Specifically, the OND noted concerns around adequate blinding, the trial results being strongly influenced by a single site, and the majority of sites for the TRCA-301/TRCA-301E trial being in Eastern Europe, where differences in patient management, including concomitant medications and diet, might affect the treatment response to veverimer and raise a concern of the applicability to a U.S. patient population. The OND also stated that, while trial results in the TRCA-301/TRCA-301E trial showed improvement in two patient-reported measures, the KDQOL Physical Functioning Survey and the Repeated Chair Stand Test, the OND viewed this subjective data from a single trial with skepticism in the absence of data from a second trial with similar results and noted that both endpoints would require rigorous blinding to support robust conclusions. However, the OND noted that both of these changes, if eventually established by one or more additional trials, would indicate a potentially meaningful benefit of veverimer treatment especially in CKD patients who have physical functional impairments. Separate from the ADL, we previously received feedback from the Division of Clinical Outcome Assessment, or DCOA, that reliance on these physical function endpoints for approval may require further validation. Based on the ADL, we believe that we now have greater clarity on the potential approval of veverimer through the Accelerated Approval Program. The OND suggested that we meet with the Division to discuss submission of Week 52 serum bicarbonate results from the full randomized trial population of VALOR-CKD and that the trial should include a substantial portion of patients from the United States or from regions with US-like patients. If the results of this trial were to demonstrate that veverimer provides a meaningfully larger treatment effect than seen in the TRCA-301/TRCA-301E trial, then this trial, along with the results from the TRCA-301/TRCA-301E trial, could address the concerns raised in the CRL regarding the limitations and the size of the treatment response observed in the TRCA-301/TRCA-301E trial. However, whether the extent of increase in serum bicarbonate in any subsequent submission based on VALOR-CKD would support accelerated approval will remain a review issue, and will, in part, reflect the Division s assessment of the adequacy (i.e., power) of VALOR-CKD to detect the anticipated treatment effect of CKD progression in a reasonable timeframe. Although the ADL provides greater clarity on the potential path for approval of veverimer through the Accelerated Approval Program, we believe the timeline to meet the requirements for accelerated approval as suggested in the ADL may not result in the most rapid development path for veverimer. For example, if either of the planned interim analyses in VALOR-CKD for early stopping for efficacy results in positive renal outcomes data, this data could be available before 26 the week 52 serum bicarbonate data from the fully enrolled VALOR-CKD trial suggested in the ADL and could potentially serve as the basis for resubmission of the NDA. We are evaluating several options with respect to the VALOR-CKD trial that are focused on obtaining, prior to the end of 2022, additional data on the effect of veverimer on (1) CKD progression; (2) physical functioning; and (3) serum bicarbonate. We may explore the possibility of stopping the trial early for administrative reasons, which would allow analysis of the data using all alpha remaining at that time. In any event, we believe data from VALOR-CKD will be very important in furthering our understanding of the regulatory path for approval of veverimer. As such, we intend to continue the execution of the VALOR-CKD trial with consideration of both the accelerated and traditional approval pathways. Resubmission of the veverimer NDA may require additional clinical data beyond that provided by the VALOR-CKD trial. The FDA s acceptance of the VALOR-CKD data in support of an NDA resubmission, including its assessment of the magnitude and durability of the veverimer treatment effect across the various geographical regions where the study is conducted and the acceptability of the data from non-US countries or regions which will comprise a substantial proportion of the data from the trial, will ultimately be a review issue. Market Opportunity We estimate that there are approximately 3 million patients in the United States afflicted with metabolic acidosis and Stage 3 to 5 non-dialysis CKD and that approximately 1.1 million of such patients are under the care of a physician. Our initial target market will be focused on the approximately 600,000 patients with metabolic acidosis and CKD that are under the care of a nephrologist. We have identified approximately 5,000 nephrologists who treat approximately 80 of these patients. Given the demographics of the CKD patient population, these nephrologists are geographically concentrated on the west coast, the northeast and the southeast of the United States. We have conducted multiple surveys of practicing nephrologists designed to understand their knowledge of the link between treating metabolic acidosis and the slowing of CKD progression. In a survey of 100 nephrologists, conducted in 2019, we found that over 80 believed that treating metabolic acidosis was moderately, very or extremely important to slow kidney disease progression. We have also conducted multiple surveys of practicing nephrologists to quantify the expected market for veverimer, if approved. In a survey of 100 nephrologists, conducted in 2019, 79 indicated that they would definitely or probably prescribe veverimer, based on a veverimer target product profile which included information from the results of our TRCA-301E clinical trial that were published in The Lancet in June 2019. We have also evaluated, through health and economic outcomes analyses, the potential savings to third-party payers and health benefits that could be derived through the treatment of patients with metabolic acidosis and CKD. In 2019, we completed a retrospective health economic study of pre-dialysis patients with Stage 3 to 5 CKD. The study evaluated renal outcome events and healthcare costs for 51,558 pre-dialysis patients with Stage 3 to 5 CKD derived from electronic health records, or EHRs, and corresponding medical claims from a national de-identified electronic medical record dataset over a 10-year period (2007 to 2017). The results of the study showed the following health impacts of metabolic acidosis over a 2-year period: 3 times higher likelihood of death: 31 of patients with metabolic acidosis and CKD at baseline died versus 10 of patients with CKD with normal serum bicarbonate at baseline; 3.6 times higher likelihood of starting dialysis: 18 of patients with metabolic acidosis and CKD at baseline started dialysis versus 5 of patients with CKD with normal serum bicarbonate at baseline; and 1.5 times higher likelihood to progress by 1 or more CKD stages: 38 of patients with metabolic acidosis and CKD at baseline progressed 1 or more stages of CKD versus 25 of patients with CKD with normal serum bicarbonate at baseline. In addition, the results of the study showed that healthcare costs were approximately 40 thousand per patient per year higher for patients with metabolic acidosis versus patients that had normal serum bicarbonate levels. The results of the study also suggest that each 1 mEq/L increase in serum bicarbonate can be associated with a 7 decrease in monthly all-cause healthcare costs (p Additionally, we have conducted multiple surveys of third-party payers representing healthcare coverage for over 200 million U.S. lives. Based on our surveys, as the first and only potential FDA-approved therapy for the treatment of chronic metabolic acidosis and slowing of kidney disease progression in patients with metabolic acidosis associated with CKD, we believe the majority of third-party payers will provide coverage for veverimer, which may be subject to prior authorization and/or other forms of utilization management. We also plan to offer veverimer through both retail and specialty-pharmacy providers to help ensure appropriate physician support and patient access to therapy. In addition, we have evaluated the healthcare insurance coverage mix of our target patient population and we estimate that the majority of these patients will have healthcare insurance coverage through 1) Medicaid programs, Medicare with low-income subsidy programs or Veterans Administration/Department of Defense programs which typically cover prescriptions with a low co-pay obligation for patients or 2) a commercial healthcare insurance plan where we typically can provide co-pay assistance to patients. Given the high unmet need for an FDA-approved chronic treatment for patients with metabolic acidosis and CKD, the broad understanding among nephrologists that treatment of metabolic acidosis can slow CKD progression, the favorable response from nephrologists to veverimer s target product profile, the potential health and economic benefits from treating metabolic acidosis, and our survey results which suggest that health insurers are open to providing coverage for veverimer, we believe that there is a significant opportunity for veverimer in the United States, if approved, as the first and only FDA-approved therapy for the treatment of chronic metabolic acidosis and slowing of kidney disease progression in patients with metabolic acidosis associated with CKD. In addition, we believe there is a significant market opportunity for veverimer outside the United States, if approved. We intend to seek one or more partners with international sales expertise who can obtain regulatory approval and sell veverimer in target markets. We anticipate that, in certain markets, additional clinical trials of veverimer may be required to obtain regulatory approval and/or ensure market access. Commercial Strategy and Plan We plan to initially focus our commercial launch of veverimer, if approved, on a subset of 5,000 nephrologists in the United States who care for approximately 80 of the 600,000 patients with metabolic acidosis and CKD seen by nephrologists. We believe we can reach this target market using a nephrologist-focused sales force of approximately 80 to 90 individuals. Alternatively, we may seek to commercialize veverimer in the United States with one or more partners. In 2020, we expanded our disease awareness campaign with extensive disease awareness outreach to engage with nephrologists. Our comprehensive disease awareness and education campaign is designed to communicate the existing evidence that increasing serum bicarbonate in patients with metabolic acidosis and CKD slows the progression of CKD and can potentially improve how patients feel and function. We believe the broad understanding of this evidence will help to establish and increase the urgency to treat patients with this serious condition. Our targeted digital placements in 2020 drove nephrologists to our disease education website, MetabolicAcidosisInsights.com. We sponsored disease-related publications and continuing medical education, or CME, courses, and added features to our Neph + app that provide easy access to publicly available kidney disease treatment guidelines commonly used calculations for kidney disease and other informational resources for nephrologists. If veverimer is approved, we plan to engage with nephrologists through multiple communication channels to provide them with the veverimer prescribing information and appropriate supplemental marketing materials to augment that information. This will include branded materials for distribution to nephrologists, a branded website, a nephrologist-focused digital marketing campaign, participation in congresses and nephrology-focused events, and speaker programs that educate nephrologists on current disease knowledge and treatment options. We have also engaged with third-party payers to seek favorable coverage for veverimer, if approved. We have presented to third-party payers information about the design and results of our health economic study and shared veverimer clinical trial data in three separate third-party payer forums: 1) through an in-person survey involving 15 third-party payers covering over 200 million patient lives, 2) through a Payer Working Group Meeting involving four third-party payers representing over 150 million lives and 3) through face-to-face individual meetings with 126 third-party payers representing approximately 310 million lives. Third-party payers have indicated their perception of the likelihood of veverimer coverage is influenced by the following potential attributes of veverimer: first and only FDA-approved treatment, disease modifying, safe and efficacious and significant direct healthcare cost savings. A number of peer-reviewed publications will provide support for our disease awareness campaign and the launch of veverimer, if approved. In 2019, the results of our TRCA-301 and TRCA-301E trials were published in The Lancet (March 2019 and June 2019). A compilation of the clinical evidence that treatment of metabolic acidosis slows CKD 28 progression was published in Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (Goraya and Wesson, 2019) and a meta-analysis of the effects of treatment of metabolic acidosis in CKD was published in the Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology, or CJASN (Navaneethan et al., 2019). A critical assessment of the data related to clinical effects of sodium from sodium chloride versus sodium bicarbonate in patients with CKD-induced metabolic acidosis was published in the American Journal of Kidney Diseases, or AJKD (Bushinsky, 2019). Six presentations reporting veverimer mechanism of action and clinical data as well as health economics and clinical outcomes research related to metabolic acidosis were reported at the 2019 ASN Kidney Week Meeting. In 2020, The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics published data on the veverimer mechanism of action and a review of the mechanisms underlying metabolic acidosis-induced kidney damage in CKD was published in the Journal of American Society of Nephrology, or JASN, by Wesson et al. In addition, seven presentations were reported at the NKF Spring Clinical Meeting 2020 and 12 presentations were reported at the 2020 ASN Kidney Week Meeting describing the veverimer mechanism of action and clinical data as well as health economics and clinical outcomes research related to metabolic acidosis. Manufacturing Veverimer drug substance is a room-temperature stable, free flowing powder, composed of low-swelling, polymeric beads, approximately 100 micrometers in diameter. As a non-absorbed polymeric drug, veverimer is designed to be insoluble in water and organic solvents, and is characterized by its desired function, including high hydrochloric acid binding capacity and selectivity, and physical properties, such as minimal swelling. Characterization of the isolated intermediate and careful control of each process step define the structure of the polymer. Because the process to manufacture veverimer fundamentally defines the key polymer attributes for safety and efficacy, the process has been carefully monitored and optimized during scale-up. Veverimer is manufactured using a two-step process. This two-step approach enables, in step one, the preparation of a crosslinked polymer having a high binding capacity, and in step two, further crosslinking for low swelling and selectivity for hydrochloric acid binding. The resulting veverimer drug substance is converted into drug product by filling it into packets without the addition of excipients. Veverimer drug product is stored at room temperature. Stability studies demonstrated that veverimer is stable at room temperature for at least 12 months, and we are conducting registration stability studies that we anticipate will enable us to indicate on our label, if approved, that veverimer is stable at room temperature for up to 24 months. We contract with third-party service providers to manufacture veverimer drug substance and veverimer drug product and to perform analytical testing services. We currently have no manufacturing facilities and limited personnel with manufacturing experience. We developed the process to manufacture veverimer drug substance in-house and have successfully transferred it to three manufacturers. We believe that there are a limited number of experienced contract manufacturers in the world capable of manufacturing a polymeric drug substance such as veverimer. We currently rely on Patheon Austria GmbH Co KG, or Patheon, a subsidiary of Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., as our sole supplier for drug substance manufacturing and we have used two suppliers for drug product manufacturing. We entered into a multi-year Manufacturing and Commercial Supply Agreement with Patheon in October 2019. Patheon has agreed to manufacture and supply us with veverimer to support our initial commercialization efforts and clinical needs. We intend to initially commercialize with a single supplier for drug substance and a single supplier for drug product. Our business plan assumes that we will establish a regionally diverse and volume-appropriate portfolio of third-party manufacturers to reduce our dependency on single suppliers for drug substance and drug product in the future. We plan to continue to rely upon contract manufacturers and suppliers of raw materials for the commercial manufacture of veverimer if it is approved by regulatory authorities. We have validated the veverimer drug substance manufacturing process at Patheon to produce veverimer in a batch size of approximately 700 kg. In addition, we have manufactured sufficient amounts of drug substance to support our ongoing VALOR-CKD trial. The process to manufacture drug product has also been validated. Polymeric-based drugs like veverimer generally require large quantities of drug substance, as compared to small molecule drugs. Accordingly, we will require larger scale and/or multiple manufacturers of drug substance and drug product in order to manufacture sufficient quantities of veverimer to meet our anticipated market demand. We believe that our current production process can be optimized to meet our anticipated commercial needs without introducing changes to key veverimer properties, including binding capacity, selectivity for hydrochloric acid and non-absorption. We use acid binding, competitive anion binding and particle size measurement assays to confirm these properties. The scale of the first step in our drug substance manufacturing process, step one, is approximately 640 kg, and the scale of the second step in our drug substance manufacturing process, step two, is approximately 700 kg. We are continuing to 29 work with our current manufacturer to further optimize and scale our drug substance manufacturing process with the intention of achieving additional manufacturing capacity as well as working to secure a second manufacturer of drug substance. Our third-party service providers, their facilities and the veverimer used in our clinical trials or for commercial sale are required to be in compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP. The cGMP regulations include requirements relating to organization of personnel, buildings and facilities, equipment, control of components and packaging containers and closures, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, holding and distribution, laboratory controls, records and reports, and returned or salvaged products. The facilities manufacturing and testing our products must meet cGMP requirements and satisfy FDA or other authorities before any product is approved and before we can manufacture commercial products. Our third-party manufacturers are also subject to periodic inspections of facilities by the FDA and other authorities, including procedures and operations used in the testing and manufacture of veverimer to assess compliance with applicable regulations. Failure to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements subjects a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, including warning letters, the seizure or recall of products, injunctions, consent decrees placing significant restrictions on or suspending manufacturing operations and civil and criminal penalties. These actions could have a material impact on the availability of veverimer. Contract manufacturers at times encounter difficulties involving production yields, quality control and quality assurance, as well as shortages of qualified personnel. Intellectual Property Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our drug candidates, manufacturing and process discoveries, and other know-how, to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing U.S. and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation, trademark protection and potential in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position. Veverimer was discovered by us utilizing our proprietary technology. We have filed several non-provisional and provisional patent applications, all owned by us, relating to veverimer in the United States, certain foreign countries, and the World Intellectual Property Organization that are directed to compositions-of-matter, dosage unit forms, methods-of-treatment, medical use, and methods of manufacture. Our patent portfolio, which is solely owned by us, includes 126 patents issued in 2020 in 47 different countries, two issued U.S. composition of matter patents (U.S. Patent No. 9,205,107 B2 and No. 9,925,214 B2), four issued U.S. method of treatment patents (U.S. Patent Nos. 9,993,500 B2, 10,391,118 B2, 10,363,268 B2, and 10,369,169 B1), an issued Australian medical use patent (AU 2014274817 B2), an issued Australian composition of matter patent (AU 2019219800 B1), two issued European medical use patents (EP3 003 327 B1 and EP 3 578 185 B1), two issued European composition of matter patents (EP 3 287 133 B1 and EP 3 593 808 B1), an issued European method of manufacture patent (EP 3 229 816 B1), an issued Chinese composition of matter patent (ZL 2014 8 0032395.1), an issued Mexican medical use patent (MX 364785 B), issued Hong Kong medical use and composition patents (HK 1223288 A1 and HK 1251151, respectively), an issued Israeli medical use patent (IL 242758), an issued Russian use (Swiss-type) and composition patent (RU 2728778), an issued Russian method of manufacture patent (RU 2713416) and issued Japanese medical use and composition of matter patents (JP 6,453,860 B2 and JP 6759316 B2, respectively). Each of these issued patents is expected to expire in 2034 (with the exception of EP 3 229 816 B1, EP 3 593 808 B1 and RU 2713416, which are expected to expire in 2035), excluding any additional term resulting from patent term extension if the appropriate maintenance fees are paid. In addition, we solely own other patent applications relating to veverimer (for example, composition of matter, dosage unit form, method-of-treatment, medical use and method of manufacture patent applications, where applicable) that are currently pending in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, Hong Kong, India, Israel, Japan, Mexico, Republic of Korea, Russia, and the United States. Certain of these patent applications are also pending in Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, South Africa and Taiwan. These currently pending patent applications, if they mature into issued patents in one or more of such jurisdictions, are expected to expire between 2034 and 2038, if the appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity, and other government fees are paid. Additional patent term for the presently-issued or later-issued patents may be awarded on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis. For example, additional patent term for U.S. patents may be awarded as a result of the patent term extension provision of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Act. In the European Union 30 member countries, a supplementary protection certificate, if obtained, provides a maximum five years of market exclusivity. In Japan, the term of a patent may be extended by a maximum of five years in certain circumstances. Individual patents extend for varying periods depending on the date of filing of the patent application or the date of patent issuance and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. Generally, patents issued for regularly filed applications in the United States are effective for 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. In addition, in certain instances, a patent term can be extended to recapture a portion of the USPTO delay in issuing the patent as well as a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period. However, as to the FDA component, the restoration period cannot be longer than five years and the total patent term including the restoration period must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval. The duration of foreign patents varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically is also 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. The actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product by product basis, from country to country and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent. We also protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and other contractors. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our employees, consultants, scientific advisors or other contractors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. Our commercial success will also depend in part on not infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. It is uncertain whether the issuance of any third-party patent would require us to alter our development or commercial strategies, alter our drugs or processes, obtain licenses or cease certain activities. Our breach of any license agreements or failure to obtain a license to proprietary rights that we may require to develop or commercialize our future drugs may have a material adverse impact on us. Research and Development We are conducting development activities to support our NDA for veverimer and manufacturing of commercial supply of veverimer. We invested 148.4 million, 133.0 million and 85.6 million in research and development for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Competition Our industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. We may face competition from large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, smaller pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies, academic institutions, government agencies and research institutions and others. Many of our competitors may have significantly greater financial, technical and human resources than we have. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if competitors develop or market products or other novel technologies that are more effective, safer or less costly than veverimer, or they may obtain regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours. There are no therapies approved by the FDA for the chronic treatment of metabolic acidosis. We are aware that AstraZeneca is conducting a clinical trial to explore the use of sodium zirconium cyclosilicate in patients with hyperkalemia and metabolic acidosis associated with chronic kidney disease. The FDA has approved generic intravenous sodium bicarbonate solutions for the treatment of acute metabolic acidosis which may occur in severe renal disease, uncontrolled diabetes, and certain other disorders accompanied by a significant loss of bicarbonate; however, those therapies are used for short-term, hospital-based treatments and are not used in clinical practice to treat chronic metabolic acidosis. For many nephrologists, first-line management of metabolic acidosis in patients with CKD is to recommend a protein-restrictive diet. Retrospective analyses show that 3 to 15.0 of patients with metabolic acidosis and CKD use oral alkali supplementation, such as sodium bicarbonate, sodium citrate or, less frequently, potassium citrate. These supplements have not been approved by the FDA for the treatment of metabolic acidosis. Government Regulation 31 Government Regulation and Product Approval Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the European Union, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, postmarketing monitoring and reporting, and import and export of drug products. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. FDA Approval Process In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FFDCA, and implementing regulations. These laws and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, postmarketing monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of drug products. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as clinical hold, FDA refusal to approve pending regulatory applications, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution. The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally includes the following: completion of nonclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies according to Good Laboratory Practices, or GLP, and other applicable regulations; submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin in the United States; performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for its intended use; submission to the FDA of an NDA for a new product; satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection, if conducted, of the facility or facilities where the product candidate is manufactured to assess compliance with the FDA s current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug product candidate s identity, strength, quality, purity, and potency; potential FDA inspection of the nonclinical and clinical trial sites; potential FDA inspection of us and vendors involved in the generation of the data in support of the NDA; and FDA review and approval of the NDA. Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity, and novelty of the product candidate or disease. A clinical hold may occur at any time during the life of an IND and may affect one or more specific trials or all trials conducted under the IND. Nonclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of the product candidate s chemistry, formulation, and toxicity, as well as animal studies to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product candidate. The conduct of the nonclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including GLP. The results of nonclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about product candidate s chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long-term nonclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has neither commented on nor questioned the IND within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin. Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to healthy volunteers or subjects 32 under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted: (i) in compliance with federal regulations; (ii) in compliance with GCP, an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of subjects and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators, and monitors; as well as (iii) under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. subjects and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. The FDA may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time or impose other sanctions if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial subjects. The trial protocol and informed consent information for subjects in clinical trials must also be submitted to an institutional review board, or IRB, for approval. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB s requirements, or may impose other conditions. The study sponsor may also suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a determination that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Clinical trials to support NDAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the product candidate is usually into healthy human subjects, and the product candidate is tested to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, early evidence on effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to determine the effectiveness of the product candidate for a particular indication, dosage tolerance, and optimal dosage, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. If a product candidate demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 trials are undertaken to obtain additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of subjects, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the product candidate and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product candidate. In most cases, the FDA requires at least two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the product candidate. A single Phase 3 clinical trial may be sufficient in certain circumstances, including (1) where the clinical trial is a large multicenter clinical trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome and confirmation of the result in a second clinical trial would be practically or ethically impossible or (2) when in conjunction with other confirmatory evidence. A drug product candidate being studied in clinical trials may be made available for treatment of individual patients, in certain circumstances. Pursuant to the 21st Century Cures Act, or Cures Act, which was signed into law in December 2016, the manufacturer of an investigational product for a serious disease or condition is required to make available, such as by posting on its website, its policy on evaluating and responding to requests for individual patient access to such investigational product. During the development of a new product candidate, sponsors are given opportunities to consult with the FDA at certain points; specifically, prior to the submission of an IND, at the end of Phase 2 and before an NDA is submitted. Meetings at other times may be requested. These interactions can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date and for the FDA to provide feedback on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the meeting at the end of Phase 2 to discuss their Phase 2 clinical results and present their plans for the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials that they believe will support the approval of the new product candidate. Concurrent with clinical trials, sponsors usually complete additional animal safety studies and also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product candidate and finalize a process for manufacturing commercial quantities of the product candidate in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the quality, purity and potency of the product candidate. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its proposed shelf life. After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the United States. The NDA must include the results of all nonclinical, clinical, and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product candidate s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture, and controls. The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA is substantial. The submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee, and the applicant under an approved NDA is also subject to annual prescription drug program fees. These fees are typically increased annually. 33 The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may refuse to file any NDA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may identify necessary additional information. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information and the resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is filed, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs. Most such applications for standard review product candidates are reviewed within ten months of the date the FDA files the NDA if the product is a new molecular entity, or NME, or within ten months of submission for a non-NME; most applications for priority review product candidates are reviewed within six months of the date the FDA files the NDA if the product is an NME and within six months of submission if it is a non-NME. Priority review can be applied to a product candidate that the FDA determines has the potential to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and, if approved, would be a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness compared to available therapies. The review process for both standard and priority review may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider certain late-submitted information, or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission. This late-submitted information is typically requested by FDA. Among other things, the FDA reviews an NDA to determine whether the product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether the product candidate is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP. The FDA may also refer applications for novel product candidates, or product candidates that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts for review, evaluation, and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Additionally, the FDA may inspect the facility or the facilities at which the product candidate is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product candidate unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. To assure GCP and cGMP compliance, an applicant must incur significant expenditures of time, money and effort in the areas of training, record keeping, production, and quality control. After the FDA evaluates the NDA and manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or complete response letter, or CRL. A CRL generally describes the specific deficiencies in the application identified by the FDA and may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for FDA to reconsider the application. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. If a CRL is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA, addressing the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Prior to taking either of those actions, an applicant may decide to submit a Formal Dispute Resolution Request, or FDRR. The FDRR process offers sponsors, which includes NDA applicants, a mechanism for resolving scientific and/or medical disputes that cannot be resolved at the division level. A CRL is a regulatory action that the FDA considers appropriate for formal dispute resolution. An FDRR must include information adequate to explain the nature of the scientific and/or medical dispute and to allow the deciding official to determine the necessary steps needed to resolve the matter quickly and efficiently. Because internal Agency review of a decision that has been appealed by a sponsor must be based on the same information as was relied on to make the original decision, no new information should be submitted as part of an FDRR. As part of the FDRR process, the sponsor can request a meeting with the deciding official. If a meeting is granted, the deciding official should provide a decision on the FDRR to the sponsor within 30 calendar days after the meeting is held. If the deciding official provides an interim response or requests additional information, the timeframe for a decision on the FDRR may be delayed. If the sponsor s FDRR is denied at one management level, the sponsor can escalate its appeal to the next higher management level in the FDA s chain of command. If, or when, the deficiencies identified in a CRL have been addressed to the FDA s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug in the United States with specific prescribing information for specific indications. Even if a product candidate receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific indications and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. The FDA also may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing, or 34 dispensing in the form of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. Moreover, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug s safety or efficacy. Once granted product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing. In addition, the FDA may require confirmatory postmarketing trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, designed to further assess a product s safety and effectiveness, and testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. Foreign Clinical Studies to Support an IND or NDA The FDA may accept as support for an IND or NDA a well-designed, well-conducted, non-IND foreign clinical trial if it was conducted in accordance with GCP and the FDA is able to validate the data from the trial through an on-site inspection, if necessary. A sponsor or applicant who wishes to rely on a non-IND foreign clinical trial must submit supporting information to the FDA to demonstrate that the trial conformed to GCP. Regulatory applications based solely on foreign clinical data meeting these criteria may be approved if the foreign data are applicable to the U.S. population and U.S. medical practice, the trials have been performed by clinical investigators of recognized competence, and the data may be considered valid without the need for an on-site inspection by FDA or, if FDA considers such an inspection to be necessary, FDA is able to validate the data through an on-site inspection or other appropriate means. Failure of an application to meet any of these criteria may result in the application not being approvable based on the foreign data alone. Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA-regulated products are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, trial sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to disclose the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed in certain circumstances for up to two years after the date of completion of the trial. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs. Expedited Development and Review Programs The FDA has various programs, including Fast Track Designation, Priority Review Designation, Accelerated Approval Program and Breakthrough Therapy Designation, which are intended to expedite or simplify the process for reviewing product candidates. Even if a product candidate qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product candidate no longer meets the conditions for qualification or that the time period for FDA review or approval will be lengthened. Generally, product candidates that are eligible for these programs are those for serious or life-threatening conditions, those with the potential to address unmet medical needs and those that offer meaningful benefits over existing treatments. For example, Fast Track Designation is a process designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of product candidates to treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions and fill unmet medical needs. Priority Review Designation is designed to give a product candidate that treats a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness, an initial review within six months as compared to a standard review time of within ten months of the date the FDA receives (in the case of a non-NME) or files (in the case of an NME) the NDA. Although Fast Track Designation and Priority Review Designation do not affect the standards for approval, the FDA will attempt to facilitate early and frequent meetings with a sponsor of a Fast Track Designation product candidate and expedite review of the application for a Priority Review Designation product candidate. In addition to the Fast Track Designation and Priority Review Designation Programs discussed above, a sponsor may request Breakthrough Therapy Designation of a product candidate if the product candidate is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other therapeutics, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product candidate may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. A request for Breakthrough Therapy Designation should be submitted concurrently with, or as an amendment to, an IND, but ideally no later than the End-of-Phase 2 meeting. 35 Accelerated Approval Program Under the accelerated approval regulations, the FDA may grant accelerated approval to a product for a serious or life-threatening disease or condition that provides meaningful therapeutic advantage to patients over existing treatments based upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. Products approved through the Accelerated Approval Program must meet the same statutory standards for safety and effectiveness as those granted traditional approval. The Accelerated Approval Program is most often used in settings in which the course of a disease is long and an extended period of time is required to measure the intended clinical benefit of a product, while the effect on the surrogate endpoint occurs more rapidly. The FDA will not grant approval through the Accelerated Approval Program to products that meet standards for traditional approval. The evidence to support the determination that an endpoint is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit may include epidemiological, pathophysiological, therapeutic, pharmacologic, or other evidence developed using biomarkers, for example, or other scientific methods or tools. The FDA considers all relevant evidence and may consult external experts, as needed. Important factors for the agency s consideration include the disease process and the relationship between the drug s effect and the disease process. Approval through the Accelerated Approval Program is subject, however, to the requirement that the applicant conduct additional confirmatory postmarketing clinical trials to verify and describe the drug s clinical benefit, where there is uncertainty as to the relationship of the surrogate endpoint to the clinical benefit, or of the observed clinical endpoint to ultimate outcome. Typically, clinical benefit is verified when confirmatory clinical trials show that the drug provides a clinically meaningful positive therapeutic effect, that is, an effect on how a patient feels, functions, or survives. The FDA may require that any confirmatory trial be initiated or substantially underway prior to the submission of an application through the Accelerated Approval Program. And, if the sponsor does not pursue the confirmatory trial with due diligence or such confirmatory trial fails to confirm the drug s clinical profile or risks and benefits, the FDA may withdraw its approval of the drug. The FDA may also withdraw the approval if other evidence demonstrates that the product is not safe or effective. All promotional materials for product candidates approved through the Accelerated Approval Program are subject to prior review by the FDA. The FDA has issued labeling instructions specific to the program. For example, if a drug is approved based on a surrogate endpoint through the program, its labeling should include a succinct description of the limitations of usefulness of the drug and any uncertainty about anticipated clinical benefits. False or misleading promotional materials may also lead to expedited withdrawal of approval. Orange Book Listing, Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity Orange Book Listing Under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch Waxman Amendments, NDA applicants are required to identify to FDA each patent whose claims cover the applicant s drug or approved method of using the drug. Upon approval of a drug, the applicant must update its listing of patents to the FDA in timely fashion and each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential generic competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA. An ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredient(s), strength, route of administration, and dosage form as the reference listed drug and has been shown to be bioequivalent to the reference listed drug. Other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing, ANDA applicants are not required to conduct, or submit results of, preclinical or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product. Drugs approved under the ANDA pathway are commonly referred to as generic equivalents to the reference listed drug and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug pursuant to each state s laws on drug substitution. The ANDA applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents identified for the reference listed drug in the Orange Book. Specifically, the applicant must certify to each patent in one of the following ways: (i) the required patent information has not been filed; (ii) the listed patent has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the new product. A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product s listed patents, or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable, is called a Paragraph IV certification. For patents listed that claim an approved method of use, under certain circumstances the ANDA applicant 36 may also elect to submit a statement certifying that its proposed ANDA label does not contain (or carves out) any language regarding the patented method-of-use rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent, which is called a Section VIII statement. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents through a Paragraph IV certification, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired. If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA-holder and patentee(s) once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA (referred to as the notice letter ). The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice letter. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months from the date the notice letter is received, expiration of the patent, the date of a settlement order or consent decree signed and entered by the court stating that the patent that is the subject of the certification is invalid or not infringed, or a decision in the patent case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant. The ANDA application also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired. In some instances, an ANDA applicant may receive approval prior to expiration of certain non-patent exclusivity if the applicant seeks, and FDA permits, the omission of such exclusivity-protected information from the ANDA prescribing information. Patent Term Restoration After approval, owners of relevant drug patents may apply for up to a five-year patent extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch- Waxman Act. The allowable patent term extension is calculated as half of the product s testing phase-the time between IND and NDA submission-and all of the review phase-the time between NDA submission and approval, up to a maximum of five years. The time can be shortened if the FDA determines that the applicant did not pursue approval with due diligence. The total patent term after the extension may not exceed 14 years and only one patent may have a patent term extension. For patents that might expire during the application phase, the patent owner may request an interim patent extension. An interim patent extension increases the patent term by one year and may be renewed up to four times. For each interim patent extension granted, the post-approval patent extension is reduced by one year. The director of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office must determine that approval of the product candidate covered by the patent for which a patent extension is being sought is likely. Interim patent extensions are not available for a product candidate for which an NDA has not been submitted. Market Exclusivity Market exclusivity provisions under the FFDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FFDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A product candidate is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new product candidate containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the product candidate substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such product candidate where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FFDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an approved NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, for new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing product candidate. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for product candidates containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the nonclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. Postmarketing Requirements After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval. In addition, the FDA may under some circumstances require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of approved products that have 37 been commercialized, and the FDA under some circumstances has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these postmarketing programs. Once an NDA is approved, a product will be subject to certain post-approval requirements and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things: record-keeping requirements; reporting of adverse experiences associated with the product; providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information; therapeutic sampling and distribution requirements; notifying the FDA and gaining its approval of specified manufacturing or labeling changes; registration and listing requirements; and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among other things, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, restrictions on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product s approved labeling, limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and requirements for promotional activities involving the internet. Manufacturers, their subcontractors, and other entities involved in the manufacture of approved products, are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and some state agencies for compliance with cGMP, including data integrity requirements, and other laws. The FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMP, which impose extensive procedural, substantive and record-keeping requirements on NDA sponsors and third-party manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations would also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals, request product recalls or take other judicial or administrative actions such as warning letters, suspension of manufacturing, seizures of products, injunctive actions or other civil penalties, if a company fails to comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements, if it encounters problems after initial marketing or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered. Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, drug manufacturers in the United States must comply with applicable provisions of the Drug Supply Chain Security Act and provide and receive product tracing information, maintain appropriate licenses, ensure they only work with other properly licensed entities, and have procedures in place to identify and properly handle suspect and illegitimate product. New Legislation and Regulations From time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced and passed in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the testing, approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the FDA. In addition to new legislation, FDA regulations and policies are often revised or interpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and veverimer. It is impossible to predict whether further legislative changes will be enacted or whether FDA regulations, guidance, policies or interpretations will be changed or what the effect of such changes, if any, may be. Other U.S. Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements In the United States, our activities are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including but not limited to, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, other 38 divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (such as the Office of Inspector General and the Health Resources and Service Administration), the U.S. Department of Justice, or the DOJ, and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the DOJ, and state and local governments. For example, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs may have to comply with the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal False Claims Act, or FCA, the privacy and security provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, and similar state laws, each as amended, as applicable. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity, from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering, recommending or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term remuneration has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between therapeutic product manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, formulary managers, and anyone in a position to purchase or recommend the product on the other. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute protecting some common activities from prosecution. The exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchasing, ordering or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for protection under a statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor. Additionally, the intent standard under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or the PPACA , to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the PPACA codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the FCA (discussed below). The federal false claims and civil monetary penalty laws, including the FCA, which imposes significant penalties and can be enforced by private citizens through civil qui tam actions, prohibit any person or entity from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. A claim includes any request or demand for money or property presented to the U.S. government. For instance, historically, pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies marketing of the product for unapproved, off-label, and thus generally non-reimbursable, uses. HIPAA created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any money or property owned by, or under the control or custody of, any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payers, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by trick, scheme or device, a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Like the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the PPACA amended the intent standard for certain healthcare fraud statutes under HIPAA such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Also, many states have similar, and typically more prohibitive, fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payer. Additional information about the scope of these requirements and potential penalties is provided under Risk Factors - We may be subject to healthcare laws, regulation and enforcement; our failure to comply with these laws or regulations, or our potential involvement in enforcement activities, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial conditions of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Additionally, to the extent that veverimer may in the future be sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws. 39 We may be subject to data privacy and security regulations by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and its implementing regulations, imposes requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA s privacy and security standards directly applicable to business associates, independent contractors, or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also created four tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce HIPAA and seek attorneys fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, many state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in specified circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, are often not pre-empted by HIPAA, and may have a more prohibitive effect than HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. We expect that veverimer, if approved, may be eligible for coverage under Medicare, the federal health care program that provides health care benefits to the aged and disabled, and covers outpatient services and supplies, including certain pharmaceutical products, that are medically necessary to treat a beneficiary s health condition. In addition, veverimer may be covered and reimbursed under other government programs, such as Medicaid and the 340B Drug Pricing Program. The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services as a condition for states to receive federal matching funds for the manufacturer s outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients. Under the 340B Drug Pricing Program, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities that participate in the program. As part of the requirements to participate in these government programs, many pharmaceutical manufacturers must calculate and report certain price reporting metrics to the government, such as average manufacturer price, or AMP, and best price. There are penalties for failing to provide timely and accurate price reporting to the government, and the Right Rebate Act (effective April 2019) imposes additional penalties for knowingly misclassifying a covered outpatient drug under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. Additionally, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, or the Sunshine Act, within the PPACA, and its implementing regulations, require that certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biological and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) report annually to CMS information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to \"Covered Recipients\", or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, Covered Recipients and to report annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. The term Covered Recipients currently includes U.S.-licensed-physicians and teaching hospitals, and, for reports covering payments and other transfers of value during calendar year 2021 and submitted on or after January 1, 2022, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse-midwives. In addition, many states also govern the reporting of payments or other transfers of value, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, are often not pre-empted, and may have a more prohibitive effect than the Sunshine Act, thus further complicating compliance efforts. In order to distribute products commercially, we must comply with state laws that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of drug and biological products in a state, including, in certain states, manufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state. Some states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution, including some states that require manufacturers and others to adopt new technology capable of tracking and tracing product as it moves through the distribution chain. Several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities, and/or register their sales representatives, as well as to prohibit pharmacies and other healthcare entities from providing certain physician prescribing data to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for use in sales and marketing, and to prohibit certain other sales and marketing practices. All of our activities are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws. Ensuring business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations is a costly endeavor. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state healthcare laws described above or any other current or future governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including without limitation, civil, criminal and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, injunctions, private qui tam actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government, or refusal to allow us to enter into 40 government contracts, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting obligations and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of veverimer, if approved. In the United States and in foreign markets, sales of veverimer, if and when we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale, will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payers provide coverage and establish adequate reimbursement levels for such products. In the United States, third-party payers include federal and state healthcare programs, private managed care providers, commercial health insurers and other organizations. Adequate coverage and reimbursement from governmental healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid in the United States, and commercial payers are critical to new product acceptance. Our ability to commercialize veverimer successfully also will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. Government authorities and third-party payers, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which therapeutics they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. Coverage and reimbursement by a third-party payer may depend upon a number of factors, including the third-party payer s determination that use of a therapeutic is: a covered benefit under its health plan; safe, effective and medically necessary; appropriate for the specific patient; cost-effective; and neither experimental nor investigational. We cannot be sure that reimbursement will be available for veverimer and, if coverage and reimbursement are available, what the level of reimbursement will be. Coverage may also be more limited than the indications for which the product is approved by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Reimbursement may impact the demand for, or the price of, veverimer, if approved. Third-party payers are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity, and reviewing the cost effectiveness of medical products, therapies and services, in addition to questioning their safety and efficacy. Obtaining reimbursement for veverimer may be particularly difficult because of the higher prices often associated with branded drugs and drugs administered under the supervision of a physician. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost effectiveness of veverimer, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA approvals. Veverimer may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. Obtaining coverage and reimbursement approval of a product from a government or other third-party payer is a time-consuming and costly process that could require us to provide to each payer supporting scientific, clinical and cost-effectiveness data for the use of veverimer on a payer-by-payer basis, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained. A payer s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payer s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payers will also provide coverage for the product. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. In addition, prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payers and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of drugs from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States. It is difficult to predict how Medicare coverage and reimbursement policies will be applied to veverimer in the future and coverage and reimbursement under different federal healthcare programs are not always consistent. If reimbursement is not available or is available only at limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize veverimer. Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. In the European Union, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate 41 positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross- border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country. The marketability of veverimer, if approved, for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payers fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on managed care, the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations, and additional legislative changes in the United States has increased, and we expect will continue to increase, the pressure on healthcare pricing. The downward pressure on the rise in healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription medicines, medical devices and surgical procedures and other treatments, has become very intense. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. Healthcare Reform In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and continue to be, several legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities, and affect the ability to effectively sell product candidates for which marketing approval is obtained. Policy makers and payers in the United States and elsewhere, have undertaken efforts to contain healthcare costs, improve quality, and expand patient access to healthcare items and services. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives. For example, the PPACA substantially changed and continues to impact healthcare financing and delivery by both government payers and private insurers. Among the PPACA provisions of importance to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, in addition to those otherwise described above, are the following: an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents apportioned among these entities according to their market share in some government healthcare programs that began in 2011; an increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to 23.1 and 13.0 of the average manufacturer price, or AMP, for most branded and generic drugs, respectively, and a cap on the total rebate amount for single source and innovator drugs at 100.0 of the product's AMP; the Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, where as a condition for the manufacturers outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D program, manufacturers must agree to offer 70.0 point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period; extension of manufacturers Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care plans; expansion of the eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals and by adding mandatory eligibility categories for individuals with income at or below 138.0 of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers Medicaid rebate liability; expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the 340B Drug Discount Program; establishment of the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; expansion of healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including the FCA and the Anti-Kickback Statute, new government investigative powers, and enhanced penalties for noncompliance; 42 a separate methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted, or injected; requirements to report certain financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals, and beginning with reports submitted on January 1, 2022, financial arrangements with physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse midwives; a requirement to annually report certain information regarding drug samples that manufacturers and distributors provide to physicians; establishment of a Center for Medicare Innovation at CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending; and a licensure framework for follow on biologic products. While the Biden Administration has recently signaled its intent to pursue policies strengthening the PPACA, there have been legal and judicial, Congressional, and political challenges to certain aspects of the PPACA, as well as efforts by the Trump administration to repeal and replace certain aspects of the PPACA. President Trump signed at least two executive orders and other directives designed to delay, circumvent, or loosen certain requirements mandated by the PPACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, two bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the PPACA have been signed into law, including the repeal, effective January 1, 2019, of the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the PPACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the individual mandate. Although two courts have ruled that this repeal renders the individual mandate unconstitutional, the Supreme Court granted certiorari in March 2020, and in November 2020 heard oral arguments in an appeal to address this issue and the effect of the individual mandate repeal on the constitutionality of the PPACA as a whole. A decision is expected later in 2021. Additionally, on December 20, 2019, President Trump signed appropriations legislation for fiscal year 2020 that repealed the so called Cadillac tax on certain high-cost employer-sponsored insurance plans, for tax years beginning after December 31, 2019; the annual fee imposed on certain third-party providers based on market share, for calendar years beginning after December 31, 2020; and the medical device excise tax on nonexempt medical devices, for sales after December 31, 2019. In the future, there may be additional challenges and amendments to the PPACA. It remains to be seen precisely what new legislation will provide, when it will be enacted, and what impact it will have on the availability of healthcare and containing or lowering the cost of healthcare, including the cost of pharmaceutical products. We anticipate that the PPACA, if substantially maintained in its current form, will continue to result in additional downward pressure on coverage and the price that we receive for veverimer, and could seriously harm our business. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare and other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payers. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize veverimer. Such reforms could have an adverse effect on anticipated revenue from product candidates that we may successfully develop and for which we may obtain regulatory approval and may affect our overall financial condition and ability to develop product candidates. Further legislation or regulation could be passed that could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the PPACA was enacted. For example, the Budget Control Act of 2011, as amended, requires automatic reductions in Medicare payments for all items and services, including prescription drugs, of up to 2.0 per fiscal year. This sequestration took effect beginning on April 1, 2013 and will remain in effect through 2030 unless additional Congressional action is taken, with the exception of a temporary suspension by Congress for the period from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021 in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Moreover, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 among other things, amended the PPACA, effective January 1, 2019, to increase from 50.0 to 70.0 the point-of-sale discount to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D and to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the donut hole. Additionally, there has been increasing legislative, administrative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed federal legislation and regulations designed to, among other things, lower drug pricing, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer-sponsored patient support programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. For example, included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 were several drug price 43 reporting and transparency measures, such as a new requirement for certain Medicare plans to develop tools to display Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit information in real time and for group and health insurance issuers to report information on pharmacy benefit and drug costs to the Secretaries of HHS, Labor and the Treasury. Additionally, in December 2020, CMS issued a final regulation amending the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. The rule implements changes to align existing regulations with statutory amendments enacted pursuant to the PPACA, and includes provisions affecting price reporting related to manufacturer-sponsored patient assistance programs subject to PBM accumulator programs, certain value-based purchasing arrangements, line extensions, and authorized generics. Because certain parts of this rule were scheduled to take effect after January 20, 2021, those provisions are subject to the Regulatory Freeze Pending Review memorandum issued by the Biden Administration on January 20, 2021, which freezes implementation of certain regulations and guidance documents issued by the Trump administration that had not yet taken effect as of January 20, 2021 and, for rules that have been issued, recommends opening a new comment period for interested parties. At the state level, legislatures and agencies are increasingly passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including constraints on pricing, discounting and reimbursement; restrictions on certain product access and marketing; cost disclosure and transparency measures that require detailed reporting of drug pricing and marketing information both at product launch and in the event of a price increase; and, in some cases, measures designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. For example, the state of California passed legislation that requires drug manufacturers to notify the state at least 60 days prior to instituting price increases and Maryland passed legislation to create a drug pricing review commission that will evaluate drug cost and recommend setting an upper limit or cap for therapies deemed too expensive. We cannot predict what other reforms may ultimately be implemented at the federal or state level or the effect of any future legislation or regulation and, accordingly, face uncertainties that may result from additional reforms and their impact on our operations. Further, the implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize veverimer, if approved. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA, prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring us to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations. Additional Regulation In addition to the foregoing, state and federal laws regarding environmental protection and hazardous substances, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Resource Conservancy and Recovery Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act, affect our business. These and other laws govern our use, handling and disposal of various biological, chemical and radioactive substances used in, and wastes generated by, our operations. If our operations result in contamination of the environment or expose individuals to hazardous substances, we could be liable for damages and governmental fines. We believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and that continued compliance therewith will not have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot predict, however, how changes in these laws may affect our future operations. Other Regulations We are also subject to numerous federal, state and local laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection, fire hazard control, and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances. We may incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations now or in the future. European Union/Rest of World Government Regulation In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials, manufacturing and any future commercial sales, promotion and distribution of veverimer. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval to market veverimer, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign jurisdictions prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the products in those countries. 44 Even if a product obtains FDA marketing approval, most foreign jurisdiction require that the investigational product undergo national requirements related to clinical trials and authorization processes, similar to those in the United States. With respect to clinical trials, certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application, much like the IND, prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In the European Union, or the EU, for example, before starting a clinical trial, a valid request for authorization must be submitted by the sponsor to the competent authority of the EU Member State(s) in which the sponsor plans to conduct the clinical trial, as well as to independent Ethics Committee(s). A clinical trial may generally commence only once the relevant Ethics Committee(s) has (have) issued a favorable opinion and the competent authority of the EU Member State(s) concerned has (have) not informed the sponsor of any grounds for non-acceptance. Failure to comply with applicable EU requirements may subject a company to the rejection of the request and the prohibition to start a clinical trial. Clinical trials conducted in the EU (or the data to be used to support a marketing authorization application in the EU) must be conducted in accordance with applicable laws, GCP and GMP rules, International Conference on Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use, or ICH, guidelines and be consistent with ethical principles. Competent authorities of EU Member States regularly conduct GCP inspections to verify the sponsor s compliance with applicable rules. The sponsor is required to record all adverse events which are reported to it by investigators and submit, upon request, such records to the EU Member State in which the clinical trial is being conducted. The sponsor is also required to record and report to the relevant national competent authorities and to the Ethics Committee(s) information about suspected serious unexpected adverse reactions (i) as soon as it becomes aware of suspected serious unexpected reactions, and (ii) yearly of all suspected serious adverse reactions having occurred over the past year and to report on the subjects safety. The authorization of a clinical trial may be suspended or revoked by EU Member States in their respective territory if the conditions in the request for an authorization are no longer met, or if an EU Member State has information raising doubts about the safety or scientific validity of the clinical trial. Various penalties exist in EU Member States for non-compliance with the clinical trial rules and related requirements, for example with respect to data protection and privacy. If we or our potential collaborators fail to comply with applicable EU regulatory requirements, we may also be subject to damage compensation and civil and criminal liability. The way clinical trials are authorized and conducted in the EU will undergo a major change when the new EU Clinical Trials Regulation (Regulation 536/2014) comes into application, according to the European Commission currently expected in December 2021. The new Clinical Trials Regulation is aimed at simplifying and streamlining the approval of clinical trials in the EU. The main characteristics of the Regulation include: a streamlined application procedure via a single entry point; a single set of documents to be prepared and submitted for the application; as well as simplified reporting procedures that will spare sponsors from submitting broadly identical information separately to various bodies and different EU Member States. The current regime under the EU Member States national legislation implementing the Clinical Trials Directive (Directive 2001/20/EC) will, however, still apply three years from the date of entry into application of the Clinical Trials Regulation to (i) clinical trials applications submitted before the entry into application and (ii) clinical trials applications submitted within one year after the entry into application if the sponsor opts for old system. Requirements to conduct a clinical trial in the United Kingdom are similar. Specifically, sponsors of clinical trials taking place in the UK must obtain authorization. The clinical trial must be registered in a public database (e.g., ISRCTN registry or ClinicalTrials.gov) and the sponsor must obtain a favorable opinion from a UK ethics committee. The United Kingdom recognizes ethics and regulatory approvals for clinical trials that were granted through the EU processes before December 31, 2020, but any trial commencing after January 1, 2021 must obtain UK authorization. Non-compliance with applicable requirements may equally result in the clinical trial authorization being suspended or revoked, and sponsor may be subject to civil and criminal liability. As in the United States, no medicinal product may be placed on the EU and UK markets unless a marketing authorization has been issued. In the UK, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, or MHRA, assesses the safety, quality and efficacy of medicinal products based on applications for marketing authorizations and grants an authorization if the risk-benefit balance is considered favorable. In the EU, medicinal products may be authorized in different ways, depending on certain criteria: the national authorization procedure (i.e., via the EU Member States national authorization procedure, which later allows for application via the mutual-recognition procedure), the centralized authorization procedure (i.e., at EU level), or the decentralized authorization procedure (i.e., authorization of a product that is not yet authorized in the EU, which can simultaneously be authorized in several EU Member States). Products submitted for approval via the national procedure must follow the national authorization procedures, which vary from Member State to Member State. Products submitted for approval via the centralized procedure (compulsory for certain products and indications; e.g., human medicines containing a new active substance to treat HIV or AIDS, 45 advanced-therapy medicines, and orphan medicines, and optional for certain other products and indications) are assessed by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, a committee within the European Medicines Agency, or EMA. The CHMP assesses, inter alia, whether a medicine meets the necessary quality, safety and efficacy requirements and whether it has a positive risk-benefit balance. Products submitted for approval via the decentralized procedure, as for the mutual-recognition procedure, must first undergo an assessment performed by one Member State, or reference Member State, which another Member State may approve. Various penalties and sanctions exist in different EU Member States for non-compliance with the EU marketing authorization procedure. In addition, for centrally authorized products the European Commission may also impose financial penalties on the holders of marketing authorizations if they fail to comply with certain obligations in connection with the authorizations as well as pharmacovigilance rules (a fine up to 5 of the marketing authorization holder s turnover in the EU in the preceding business year for an infringement; daily penalty payments up to 2.5 of the marketing authorization holder s average daily turnover in the EU in the preceding business year, pending cessation of an infringement; and a fine up to 0.5 of the marketing authorization holder s turnover in the EU in the preceding business year for e.g. failure to cooperate or supply of misleading information to authorities). If we or our potential collaborators fail to comply with applicable EU or other foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution. Similar rules apply in the UK. As described above, coverage and reimbursement status of veverimer, if approved, are provided for by the national laws of EU Member States. The requirements may differ significantly across the EU Member States. Also, at EU Member State level, actions have been taken to enact transparency laws regarding payments between pharmaceutical companies and health care professionals, or HCPs. We are subject to European data protection laws, including the EU General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679, or GDPR (as implemented by EU Member States and the UK). The GDPR which came into effect on May 25, 2018, establishes requirements applicable to the processing of personal data (i.e., data which identifies an individual or from which an individual is identifiable), affords various data protection rights to individuals (e.g., the right to erasure of personal data) and imposes potential penalties for serious breaches of up to 4.0 annual worldwide turnover or 20 million, whichever is greater. Individuals (e.g., study subjects) also have a right to compensation for financial or non-financial losses (e.g., distress). The GDPR increases our responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that we process, and additional mechanisms put in place to address compliance with the GDPR must be kept under review as the legislative and regulatory landscape for data protection in Europe continues to evolve. For other countries outside of the European Union and the United Kingdom, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, again, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements. The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, privacy and data protection, pricing and reimbursement also vary from country to country.
